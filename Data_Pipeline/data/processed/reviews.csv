17710652,574904556,4.0,1.0,2.0,0,positive,ive had webroot for a few years it expired and i decided to purchase a renewal on amazon i went through hell trying to uninstall the expired version in order to install the new  i called webroot and had their representative remote into my computer at his request he was clueless as a bad joke and consumed 29 minutes and 57 seconds of my time forever  he initially told me it wasnt compatible with windows 10 but i finally managed to convince him that it is indeed compatible with windows 10 as it was working on my computer before it expired and also i showed him a review on amazon to convince him that it works on windows 10 finally he offered to connect me with a senior consultant for over 100 dollars i declined and told him id fix the issue myself this guy was less helpful than a severed limb  after spending some time on google the issue is now fixed webroot should just get rid of their customer service and pay google for indexing much more helpful info that their dedicated customer service can offer  as far as the software itself i think it scans fast does not slow down my computer and i hope like most other people including experts that its very effective in removing and preventing malware  years ago i did extensive research and found it to be among the best but that was over 4 years ago things are fluid in the malware kingdom  to those experiencing the same issue installing as i did  my advice  dont bother uninstalling the old version rather launch webroot and click on  34my account34 on the right side then copy and past your product key in the area that says 34enter a new keycode34 then click on activate this will save numerous painful hours of trying to get the thing to work,Digital_Software

51726655,129292107,4.0,0.0,1.0,0,positive,ive used turbotax annually for several years  overall i still find it useful  one reservation is that this system and some others have evolved to where you just put in numbers and proceed blindly along until the end and you are supposed to trust that everything is being done correctly even though it is all out of sight  numbers flow into some forms that you never see at the time of entry until you are told you are done and you print out the final data or save as a pdf  since i only do this once a year i prefer a bit more informationreassurance along the way that all is being done correctly and appropriately  it did save me a few dollars somewhere  im still not sure where,Digital_Software

13368882,235293272,5.0,1.0,1.0,0,positive,cookn is very easy to use because of their simple clean design  this is what sold me on their software over 5 years ago  the software contains some of the best features you can find in any recipe program particularly the ability to capture recipes from almost any source  this feature has saved me countless hours of retyping the recipes that i find on the internet  also some recipes that i find on the internet are uniquely formatted and do not import properly into any of the programs however the use of the snipit tool makes 34cutting and pasting34 almost automatic  additionally the customer service is very responsive only through email however  they have responded within 2 days with answers and step by step guidance to resolve any issues many of which were my own  the ability to save all my recipes to the cloud gives me the freedom to plan meals on the fly with either my ipad or android device i find this useful when i am not planning my meals but am shopping and seeing what is on sale  retrieving recipes on the fly assures me that i leave the store with all the ingredients necessary  i have recommend this program to all my friends and i recommend this program to anyone reading this review,Digital_Software

52068357,925385625,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,negative,tldr quicken sucks horribly for budgeting and pretty much everything else if you want to budget go use ynabbr br like nearly everybody when i wanted to get control of my finances i started out in mint and it was fantastic i was able to get all of my accounts on there get in the habit of categorizing my transactions keeping track of my upcoming bills and really start to get a handle on thingsbr after about 6 months of working in mint i wanted to start to get more involved in reports and budgeting and decided to upgrade to quicken i had used quicken a long time ago and for many reviews it was still seen as the standard for personal finance plus my parents have used it for years  its also put together by intuit i figured it was the natural progression and good movebr br what a mistake that was quicken 2015 is a cluster its just horriblebr br first of all you cant migrate your mint transaction and history straight to quicken this baffles me and was one of the assumptions i had made in my decision mint is made by intuit quicken is made by intuit youd think that moving from one to another would be easy it was a horrible week long trial of downloading the files from mint trying to shove them through one third party converter or another i even tried editing them by hand in an effort to get quicken to recognize them in the end i was forced to just recreate all of my accounts in quicken all of my categories i had setup in mint and assigned transactions to were gone plus i had to go back and recategorize the transactions that quicken had now downloaded from my banks even after all of that i still had 23 accounts that quicken did weird things with when interacting with my banks and i had to do those manually anyway fyi just because your bank interacts with mint doesnt mean itll do the same with quickenbr br it took me months to get back to the point i had with mint where my accounts were all generally stable and i could get around quicken so i decided to try setting up a budget first the help section on budgeting in quicken from the website is pathetic its like a single page consisting of 1 click on this button to create a budget 2 name your budget 3 save your budget which makes it sound all nice and easy but as before it was a rabbit hole of frustration with not understanding what the hell was going on where was it getting these numbers from and what do these numbers even mean anyway i was being forced to budget for interest on my mortgage rather than just the payment it kept telling me that i needed to budget for my 401k contribution which came out of my paycheck in the end i had no way of telling where i was at in my frankenstein monster of a budget anywaybr br in frustration i downloaded the free trial for ynab and omg what a difference in contrast to the hours and hours i had spent wrestling with quicken i had my all of my accounts and my budget setup in ynab within a couple of hours when i had questions on how to set stuff up or what i should do with a particular situation ynab had articles tutorials videos and even a free online live class that quickly answered all my questions and got me completely setup it is so easy and unlike quicken is built from scratch to work with your budget its so easy to download and import my transactions into ynab that im done in like 2 minutes a day its at the point where im wondering if im really doing everything i need to do with my finances because im done so fast and im on a budget for the first time in my life im on a budget and it feels fantasticbr br so in the end mint is great for what it does but when you want to do more with budgeting dont move to quicken go to ynab,Digital_Software

50365571,201884757,2.0,17.0,25.0,0,negative,windows 10 was designed to correct the design mistakes of windows 8 and upgrade the popular windows 7 in other words it was to be the successor to windows 7 with additional features and flashy designsbr br in a nutshell the new product does not confuse users with radical changes true to legacy the familiar features are present there is a start button right click the start button will get a menu of familiar pages such as control panel view devices and printers change desktop background and others however there are problems that discourage consumers to switch they include the followingbr br 1 installing the home premium version was a complete failure the free download upgrade version was impossible after clicking the agreement box the rotating blue arrow continued in an endless loop for hours  signifying that installation was taking place after waiting three hours i clicked the cancel button next i downloaded the iso version on the microsoft website burned the image on dvd and install that on the final stage the program 34locked up34  typing the access password was impossible a hard boot destroyed the installation and forced the computer to revert back to the previous windows 7 os i tired again  three times  with the same results    in the end i gave upbr br 2 the professional version did not experience the above so i was able to test it again there were significant problems software compatibility was a major one firewalls software drivers and antivirus programs did not work especially bit defender and commodo internet security microsoft office 2003 and 2000 crashed and froze the computer macrium reflect tried to construct an image of my windows 10 partition at 97 completion the program hanged and everything froze hardware compatibility was 34the great game changer34 my 3500 epson scanner was totally uselessbr br 3 34teething problems34 were common as little errors erupted every week the os upgrades on tuesdays would solve one error but they also created new ones one major irritant was a booting loop last week the os kept rebooting over and over until the fifth cycle the user was stuck with the problem until the next tuesday os upgrade there was no guarantee that anything would work afterwards if not enough complaints were relayed to microsoft engineers that week or if the problems were too complicated the 34bugs34 were not fixed issues like these could be avoided if users were able to refuse the most recent os upgrade and go back to the previous setting unfortunately there was no option windows 10 forcefully made changesbr br 4 missing were many useful programs that came with windows 7 especially windows multimedia player and gadgets the former was essential click a video file and it automatically played the latter series were very useful in front of me on the computer screen were oversized icons that provided instant information analog clock calendar weather local weather reports for the week memory and cpu usage internet download and upload information latest news flashes and anything imaginable in short it is very hard to live without thesebr br 5 if you are going to upgrade instead of installing from scratch you need to commit two to three hours of uninstalling almost all of your old software and hardware drivers to avoid incompatibility problems almost everything has to go except window 7 motherboard utilities and video card drivers next you activate the windows 10 upgrade this is followed by reinstalling everythingbr br 6 the other choice  a clean install  is also a hassle the booting hard drive has to be reformatted to gpt or windows will not installbr br 7 the biggest concern is spelled out in microsofts 12000 word service agreement 34we will access disclose and preserve personal data including your content such as the content of your emails other private communications or files in private folders when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to protect our customers or enforce the terms governing the use of the services34br br in a nutshell this gives ms the legal right to record and preserve all of your computer activities internet searches emails and writings there are two possible reasons for this first the company is able to collect the data and sort them it is able to sell the information to marketers who will directly focus their sales pitches to a ready market second i suspect that this is necessary for the operation of cortana this new help feature is like siri for the iphone you ask a question and the computer will quickly provide the answer in preparation cortana has to record all of the users computer activities and build an indexed database on the information a quick search for the possible answers will enable cortana to provide a ready response if a question is asked in the futurebr br my biggest fears are the unknown and unpredictable possibilities that may come back and haunt the user in the future legally the government and courts can force microsoft hand over this information so if i accidentally stumbled into a porn or isis site or wrote notes for a school debate on terrorism or received an unwanted email advertisement from a firm that specializes on questionable tax shelter plans or received a misrouted twitter message from a militia group advocating the assassination of the president can this provide the evidence against me in a future divorce hearing or trigger a fbi or irs or secret service investigation legally this is 34probably cause34 and can be used against youbr br so if you want to use the 34latest and greatest34 os wait six months until all the 34bugs34 are removed  windows 10 is not ready for 34prime time34 for all others especially windows 7 users it is folly to upgrade if your present operating system works without any problems for me i do not want to be a guinea pig to test mss faulty os system and locate the 34bugs34 i do not want to spend hours installing and troubleshooting my computer i am not spending thousands of dollars to purchase software updates and another epson scanner for the privilege of using the latest microsoft product more important i do not want to be spied on and have every activity preservedbr br unless you have endless hours to waste a fortune to spend and your computering activities recorded this operating system

technical writers rave on the new features speed and flashy screen designs techkies join the bandwagon and spread the excitement consumers buy the 34new and improved product34 three to five years later the process repeats with the introduction of the next technological wonderbr br this is not reality an operating system is like electricity it should be dependable safe and problemless more important its only function is to seamlessly operate in the background and allow users to connect and activate their equipment and software it makes them work without any issuesbr br just image the chaos if your electrical company operated like microsoft every three to five years the utility wants to be on the cutting edge of technology and improves its product so firm makes small changes to voltage varies the watts transmitted and alters the outlet socket design many older appliances and electrical equipment have to be repurchased for newer models in order to cope with these upgrades in service in the process consumers spend thousands of dollars for a time the new equipment suffers constant breakdowns and need repairs because of the new electrical changesbr br the above scenario is my justification for not upgrading for me it is silly to buy another 3500 scanner update several thousand dollars worth of software find an inferior replacement for windows media player and give up my gadgets  which i use everyday   it is sillier to do this every three to five years because pundits and their followers hype the next new product  34you can not live without this34br br to switch over to windows 10 i am giving up problemless computering for what    i am getting a new os that is 34buggy34 for the next six months to a year these include screen freezes software crashes and boot loops

50750054,160856180,5.0,2.0,2.0,0,positive,corel painter is a must if you are serious about digital art as its unparalleled in the way it mimics traditional media i illustrate childrens books and painter is an important part of my arsenal of digital tools i wouldnt want to be without itbr br  it seems like many new to digital art wonder whether they should purchase photoshop or painter or something else painter is a necessary tool if you want to create art more like the 34oldfashioned34 way like you would in a real life art studio with real paints etc and are not intimidated by having to learn a very robust and deep program painter is the program where digital tools behave more like their counterparts in the real world watercolors 34dry34 on your digital canvas you can mix oil paints just like you would real oil paints in an art studio and the digital chalks have that 34chalky34 texture even the digital markers behave like real ones  going on somewhat transparently with overlapping strokes that become more opaque as you continue coloring painter has tons of tools with endless variations and the ability to customize to your hearts content you get to play with acrylics airbrushes charcoal  conte chalk crayons gels gouache liquid inks pastels sumie watercolors and lots more there are even particle brushes that create amazing effects like smoke  dynamic fur as well as pens that paint patterns of flowers or chain or even neon there are also tools that mimic famous painters styles like van gogh seurat impressionist style and so on you could sit and 34play34 all day and not even go over ever possibility of every tool you can even change all of the settings for each tool to make it something really unique and save your settings to use again and again there are over 25 categories of brushes each with a multitude of variants i looked up the official number of brushes and there are 806 compare that to the 126 brushes in painter essentials look at the screenshot i uploaded of some of the paint marks i made with various brushes i went through the categories and painted on the canvas with different ones so you can see just a tiny bit of the options youd have with painter its like having an art store on your computer you can even pick out different types of paper  canvas smooth textured colored whateverbr br you dont have to be a traditional artist to use painter though painter also has the capability to take a photograph and turn it into a painting using the multitude of brush options via cloning options it also has tracing paper quick cloning is a timesaving tool i sometimes use to make some of the backgrounds for my illustrations the computer does a lot of the work to turn a picture into a painting in seconds or minutes with all sorts of options to make things unique but you can finetune it and add your own personal touches so that its not totally cheating lol the 2nd screenshot i uploaded of a flower is something i made using the tracing paper and the cloning tools it took me about 4 minutes to create with painter you can create art that is nearly impossible to create in the 34real world34 and it has an undo button br br there are also photoshop style tools layer capabilities like many layers of glass that overlap that you can drawpaint on selection tools vector pen tools a paint bucket to dump color or patterns like plaids and so on onto your canvas or into a selection color correction and other digital tools you can find in just about any digital photo  art program you really dont want to use painter for photo editing though thats more of a job for photoshop painter is forwell painting lol and drawing sketching airbrushing etc you can paint and draw in photoshop but thats not its original design purpose i use both along with manga studio  clip studio paint krita illustrator and sketchbook pro theyare all important tools that excel in different things  another reviewer likened the painter and photoshop to a hammer vs a screwdriver and hes spot on i have to have photoshop to accomplish specific tasks painter just cant do a lot of image manipulation and that type of thing i have to have painter to mimic the real life painting techniques that photoshop just cant do bottom line is if you want to paint get painter if you want to do digital art that is more about manipulating images get photoshop if you can stomach the nasty subscription model they moved to  i personally am sticking with photoshop cs6 until i can find an alternativebr br please note that in my opinion  experience painter is not the best for inking think comic book style drawing ive found that manga studio which is also known as clip studio paint is better for that in that the lines are nice and better stabilized there is a slider that will make it so it will auto correct tiny jitters as you draw it is also not the best if you just want to sketch getting painter to sketch is overkill and there are other programs that are better for drawing i think painter is truly best suited for painting watercolors oils acrylics etcbr br if you are new to digital art i recommend getting your feet wet first in something like sketchbook pro or painter essentials that is much more inexpensive and easier to use sketchbook pro is easy enough for a child to use you can literally sit down open it up and start sketching and drawing in no time you can take a look at my review here on amazon under my profile the basic tools are intuitive from the outset and its very freeing not to have to learn all sorts of complicated controls  commands etc  especially for a beginner you can try it to see if you like digital art and then if you do you might be interested in pursuing something like painter to take a step in a more professional direction  painter is a quite a bit more of a challenge with endless options that can be daunting to a new user but corel offers lots of free video tutorials to help you get started also if you would like to learn how to use it quickly i recommend getting a months subscription to lyndacom they have a great beginning video course on how to use painter that goes over the various tools and how to get the most from them ive been using painter for about 15 years and even i learned something from the lyndacom video for the 2015 versionbr br please note if you are interested in purchasing painter you really need a digital tablet to draw directly on such as a wacom intuos or cintiq this is not a program to use with a mouse imagine writing your name on paper with a tool shaped like a mouse you need a digital pen in hand i have used it with both of the above painter works very well with wacom tablets and responds to the tilt speed pressure etc of the wacom pens there are less expensive tablet options yiynova huion etc but they are not in my opinion as good as wacom if you have something like a surface pro you can already draw directly on the screen anyway the point is you need something to draw with other than a mouse br br if you already have painter and are wondering if an upgrade is worth it for me it was the brushes are much faster no more lag time the brushes track better and the new particle brushes are amazing and fun to play with lol i recommend trying the 30 day free trial to see if the upgrades are worth it which is what i did the increase in speed alone was so worth it for me im on a bit of an older computer so lots of my art programs lag if i have a really big brush etcbr br also dont be afraid to get painter as a digital download if you are like me and want the instant gratification of receiving your purchase right then and there lol ive purchased software downloads from amazon numerous times with no hitchesbr br if after reading this review you have any questions please ask via the comment button below ill be happy to try and help outbr br bottom line painter is a worthwhile program that is the best at mimicking real life media but especially paint if you want to take your digital art to the next level or want something that will behave more like the 34real34 stuff and less like digital tools this is what you are looking for just keep in mind that there is a lot to learn and if you are a beginner you might be best served by a less expensive program to start with painter is an amazing tool that helps me create my illustrations and i highly recommend it with that particular reservation in mind ons that can be daunting to a new user but corel offers lots of free video tutorials to help you get started also if you would like to learn how to use it quickly i recommend getting a months subscription to lyndacom they have a great beginning video course on how to use painter that goes over the various tools and how to get the most from them ive been using painter for about 15 years and even i learned something from the lyndacom video for the 2015 version  please note if you are interested in purchasing

53018817,439266477,1.0,8.0,12.0,0,negative,this was a horrible experience  i reserved windows 10 pro for three computers one laptop two desktops  that have been running windows 7 ultimate since it came out  i have always been an avid microsoft and windows fan  i have vowed to never let my fingers touch a mac  i loved windows xp hated vista as much as apple and most of all i really loved windows 7  i never bothered with windows eight because it looked like it was primarily meant for tablets and other touch screen devices  however after reading the reviews and an opportunity to try windows 10 for free i reserved the product for all three computers  i was notified in two days that it was available for my laptop and i downloaded and installed the upgrade it went well and i started to try it out  wow i was really impressed and called several friends and family to tell them  i was so excited about it that i decided to not wait for the upgrade from the app and went online to download the upgrade for one of my desktops from microsoft manually  mistake number 1  after it was installed i found i couldnt do certain things with it because it wasnt activated  when i went to activate it it sent me to the store and wanted 199 for a key i decided no way was i paying for something i could get for free so i went to restore windows 7  i told the restore program to save my files which it would do but then i got a message that all my apps including ms office would be deleted  and i would have to reload all of them  fortunately all my computers have backup drives and before installing the upgrade i had saved an image file of my old setup so thats what i did while i was waiting for ms to notify me that my program was ready for installation  later that day i went to edit a word file on my windows 10 laptop and when i tried to save it i got a message that it was a read only file and i would have to save it under a different name  i tried that and got another message that i was not authorized to edit files  i got the same response in excel and access  of course you cant get any support from ms on the phone any more but i checked the forums and found others with the same problem i was told i could edit the permissions section fortunately i am the only one using this computer so that anyone could have full access  i did this and it solved that problem  then i found i lost the start menu and cortana  the icons were still there but the programs wouldnt come up  you can no longer manually set up a restore point but they had made a critical update and i was able to restore to that point  now i had cortana and the start menu back but i was getting read only files again  i was going to try to reset the permissions again but first i had to post some financial stuff on quicken  lo and behold i got the same read only message on it  that was the final straw  i cant spend my life fighting a computer  i already knew i was going to have to restore my old image file and thats what i did  i still love windows 7 and it looks like ill be using it a long timebr br microsoft you let me down  my advice if you decide to try it be sure you have an external backup image or your life may be worse than minedit files  i got the same response in excel and access  of course you cant get any support from ms on the phone any more but i checked the forums and found others with the same problem i was told i could edit the permissions section fortunately i am the only one using this computer so that anyone could have full access  i did this and it solved that problem  then i found i lost the start menu and cortana  the icons were still there but the programs wouldnt come up  you can no longer manually set up a restore point but they had made a critical update and i was able to restore to that point  now i had cortana and the start menu back but i was getting read only files again  i was going to try to reset the permissions again but first i had to post some financial stuff on quicken  lo and behold i got the same read only message on it  that was the final straw  i cant spend my life fighting a computer  i already knew i was going to have to restore my old image file and thats what i did  i still love windows 7 and it looks like ill be using it a long time  microsoft you let me down  my advice if you decide to try it be sure you have an external backup image or your life may be worse than mine,Digital_Software

35150034,925385625,4.0,1.0,1.0,0,positive,i used quicken a very long time ago like in the 90s and recently decided to start using it again to help me organize my finances  here are a couple things i found very helpfulbr br mobile  quicken deluxe 2015 allows you to use the mobile app for free  you need a quicken account and once thats established your client version quicken on your personal computer syncs your accounts registration entries on the cloud quicken cloud  your mobile device syncs to the cloud as well and allows you to track not just the money your spending but where the transaction took place and the ability to take pictures of your receipt  the resolution of the picture is fine  viewing it from your client requires you to download the picture if you want to zoom in and outbr br one step update  this feature is extremely helpful for me because im way too busy to deal with my transactions manually  quicken has a one step update that allows me to download all my transactions automatically from my bank accounts credit cards loans and retirement account  it was very easy to setup for me  sometimes i have to run the update a few times because something went wrong when trying to connect to the institutions server  i experience that when i go directly to the institutions website so im pretty sure its not entirely quickens fault or even that its their fault at all  at the very least they give you an explanation of what happenedbr br so why a four start and not a five star  my bank actually charged me a fee for connecting quicken to my bank  it came in the form of an online fee  i should have known better and this is not quickens fault at all either  would be nice if quicken had the ability to flag banks that charge for the connection fee  maybe they do and i just dont know about it  if someone can show me that they do ill will switch this review to a five star because i really like this app,Digital_Software

23181736,331560305,5.0,2.0,2.0,0,positive,my hobby is collecting movies on disc  since i already pay for these movies either by renting them online or by paying for video streaming i have the right called right of use to copy these movies to disc for my own personal collection  since copy protection was put in place it has been a real challenge to find a way to copy movies to disc since all disc recorders are now programmed not to write movies to disc if they are copy protected  ive tried using devices that strip the copy protection out like grex dimax  the problem with that is the best quality i could get was 480i since i had to use s video cables to do this  in addition regardless of what the sellers of these types of devices say it does degrade the quality of the picture and you can really see it on a 5234 hd tv  then i found audials moviebox i downloaded the trial version which is extremely limited in functionality but theres enough functionality to validate whether the product really works  although the trial version says that it will record for only 10 minutes my experience was that it would record for only 2 minutes  but that was enough to create a video and play it on my blu ray player and look at it on my 5234 hd tv  omg the quality is incredible  it records in 720p and there are levels of quality you can select based on size the number of gb but when i play it on an upconverter like a blu ray player it looks like 1080i  i am thrilled  the only drawback is i think the help documentation within the software could be better and the software is not intuitive im in technology and design applications and our philosophy is that a user should be able to use an application without any help at all  moviebox is far from that but after a couple of hours i got it and once you get it its a piece of cake  copying a 3 or 4 hour movie would be a challenge if using rw discs since they have capacity for only 47 gb  but in that case i think i would make it a 2 disc movie so there is a workaround  you stream the movie on your computer and hit record in moviebox so you must have a computer that has enough memory and processor speed to handle this software otherwise it will hang the specs are on the audials web site  i would highly recommend this software,Digital_Software
27364030,201884757,5.0,6.0,19.0,0,positive,so far so good  just upgraded and bought an msi nightblade gaming pc with windows 10 and also used usb flash to upgrade my laptop  so far windows 10 works great  i never really had that many issues with windows 8 but it did make me want to try mac os which i did for a while  after becoming tired with my limitations of the macos platform i switched back to windows 10 and bought a new pc  thus far the windows 10 os is performing excellent and even my older game and programs work great and if they run into an issue windows 10 runs the troubleshoot window and gets it working quickly which is awesome  i transferred all my music from my mac to windows 10 seamlessly which is a huge plus when changing operating systems  the system boots up and is fully ready to use within seconds  the latest build of the edge browser is great fast and with the addition of add ons its my new favorite browser  very pleased  my laptop upgrade from windows 81 to windows 10 was also easy and worked right the first time the laptop now actually runs better which was nice  i was skeptical when i read about the privacy issues but you can configure what data is collected and the stuff that is collected is the same data mac os or any other system logs  very nice job microsoft great new operating systemu somewhere else do you understand why its freemore like freemiumbr br the new edge browser simply sucks compared to any other browsers out there including internet explorer when you launch edge it gives you an infinite scrolling screen of msn news and ads that you cannot turn off at least i cannot find a way to do it with a search bar saying 34where to next34 where you can do a web search with bing i wanted to change my web search to yahoo but it required going to yahoocom then opening then new edge menu bar and adding it then setting it to default users on windows 78 will have trouble with this as it can be very tricky to find i didnt find many positives with edge it loads up decently but whats the use when you have an a fraction of the options and customizations you have with any other browser and the fact that edge doesnt support a lot of websites hence why windows 10 still has internet explorer tucked away i can draw on the web page im looking atwhoopee its the app version of internet explorer on windows 8 with microsoft paint integrationbr br the os feels more like a phone than ever before  if you boot up windows 81 then took a windows phone and laid it on the bottom left corner of the pc monitor screen you have windows 10 it almost runs like an advertising tool for microsoft to sell you useless crap via tiles and notifications popping up i tried playing my games that i was running fine on windows 817 and there are many issues and graphics issues some games like borderlandsborderlands 2 have major graphic issues now where bushes and bullets look like paint blotches splattered on the screen no matter how much you play with the video options dead island left 4 dead 2 and dying light will not work at all they simply crash when launched so im wondering if my ati radeon card is having windows 10 update issues as they worked on 81  wow just stopped working as well battlenet app freezes and looses track ofwhere the files are stored on my pc but now works fine since i deleted this microsoft spyware off my pc and went back to 81br br windows 10 update will override the drivers installed by your graphics card suite causing crashes graphical problems and infinite restarts if the driver you have installed is not the one big brother has in their auto update again i had hopes that microsoft would actually deliver a quality product like windows 7 but instead we get a lazy freemium version of windows 81 that rivals google it terms of disgusting spyingdata stealing for profit windows 10 is 34freemium34 not free you pay for it by giving up every ounce of privacy for microsofts financial benefit  they baseically turn your pc into a microsoft server your pc can also be used to upload updates to other pc usersowners like a hotspotbr br im glad that i switched to osx again a few months back and only use windows on my secondary computer i wont be putting this garbage on my mac if you do upgrade the first thing you should do is go into every settings menu you can find and check the privacy options you will still be data mined just not as badly you will have to do this more than once as there are for example two control panelsnamed the same but both with their own privacy settings  the split personality of windows 8 is back in full effect  in short windows 10 is just windows 81 freemium edition you even still have to right click the start menu to get control panel one of them and stuff quickly because if you traditionally left click on it it wil just shows you apps and useless tile garbage basically the windows 8 start screen in a box instead of desktop features and shortcuts to things you actually needbr br windows 10 is a total failure the people claiming it to be windows christ are simply dreaming or paid to say so stick to windows 781 windows 10 is nothing like windows 7 try it first on an old computer if you are curious if you hate windows 8 windows 10 will not improve anything you will still be using the same failed phonepc hybrid operating system but you will have to give up all your privacy for nothing you cant do on windows 781 apparently you will also be paying for games like solitaire 149 a month and 1499 for a dvdblue ray play back software  hopefully anyone can

17437834,224892688,5.0,3.0,3.0,0,positive,i know there have been foul reviews of this program the downloaded version as well as the disc version but i downloaded and installed it last night worked with it for two hours this morning and its performing beautifully i thought id be shackled to saving documents in rtf through the simple text editor provided with the program but was pleasantly surprised to find version 13 works with microsoft word 2007 regardless the software requirements for version 13 specify it works with a much later versionbr br i was previously using ibms via voice on a windows xp netbook and needed something that works on my hp laptop running 81 which was targeted for use by a college student so it hasnt a great lot of ram or the best processor i was wary after reading the multiple negative reviews but decided to take the risk regardless amazon will not give you a refund on software downloads if the program wont work for you so buyer bewarebr br i did have to download the package twice the first time certain dll files didnt unpack correctly and amazons installation told me to download a fresh package it took two hours each time on broadband for the download to complete but its a huge program so deal with it the second time it installed and registered itself without a hitch im not ecstatic about having to 34open an account34 with nuance in order to register the software but thats nuances marketing issue not amazonsbr br to make this software work correctly you do have to be patient take your time and give the app decent samples of your voice over time one time is not enough but the initial reading is dictated by the program subsequent 34readings34 come from the documents you dictates the initial reading choice ranges from 34charlie  and the chocolate factory34 to arthur clarkes 343001 a spacewhatever it is34br br you do have to slow down be patient and help the program interpret yourvoice the first few times you use the software so if youre expecting to be able to dictate doctor zhivago first thing out of the box youll want to table that plan for a couple of daysbr br you do have to let it analyze additional dictation samples and train the program so it will work faster and better for you do try to remember that it knows how to work with myriad international accents so its got a few things to work out regarding how you speak  which isnt like anyone else on the planet so hey youre looking at an invention that would be considered magic a couple hundred years ago be patient and maybe a little grateful and it will work better for you the longer you use itbr br i didnt find the correction feature cumbersome at all  if you take the time to download the 34cheatsheet34 list of voice commands from nuance just google for 34dragon naturallyspeaking 13 cheatsheet34 and youll be led to the pdf for download and if you take the time to download and look at 34dragon naturallyspeaking workbook34 and the user guide again google for them the program works a lot faster and better if you use the voice commands on the other hand if youre impatient and dont wanna learn the commandsif youre determined to edit by highlighting and retyping text well then prepare to be frustratedbr br the more you use your voice the more this dragon becomes your personal friendbr br be warned that the first hour or so of dictation dragon willbeslow to type what you say it will lag severely this is because its learning about you be patient and use the 34acoustic and language model optimizer34 see the user guide or poke around in the 34audio34 menu after you dictate each sizable document and again be patient enough to give dragon the 20 or 60 minutes it needs to build a profile of how you speak so it can serve you better yes you have to do this repeatedly did you expect yourchild to walk the first time he or she managed to stand up you can schedule the optimizer to do its analysis at 3 am if youre impatient and dont want to wait around for it to finishbr br im using dragon to dictate notes containing a lot of specific 15thcentury terms including quotes from parliamentary acts in archaictomodern middle english and weird citytown names behold it already knows the names of people from the middle ages which surprised me and it even knew how to spell oubliette which i wasnt expecting how many people use that word after all it may have problems with latin terms but its willing to learn once the word or phrase is entered and you take the time to record yourself saying it the learning sticks if you dont

br if your computer is running windows 10 windows 8 windows 7 windows vista or windows xp windows defender removes spyware but to protect yourself from viruses youll need to download antivirus

decent job apple can still catch viruses now days but windows computer are ridicules when it comes to catching virus so antivirus is def neededbr br this statement is form microsoft website directlybr br if your computer is running windows 10 windows 8 windows 7 windows vista or windows xp windows defender removes spyware but to protect yourself from viruses youll need to download antivirus software you can purchase it from a third party or you can download microsoft security essentials for freebr br from statement above i can tell you that microsoft security essentials and windows defender are useless i personally dont even like the free antiviruses out their i preferred paid ones that also have tech support to help you every company will give you a free and then has a paid one with paid ones are their priority when a new virus comes out and they need to release the deification to general public to block it that being said there is not perfect antivirus out there new infection arise on the internet every minutebr br as far as apple osx goes well remember that if you want to develop apple application their are requirements that you have to fallow per apple they verify apps or you will get a notification like application is from unidentified developer so viruses are little harder to create on apple but they are coming too vs windows computer microsoft doesnt care about who makes what they are too open and that is why they will probably never have a virus free operating systembr br  windows media center and windows 7 desktop gadgets are no longer

22105748,521201578,3.0,1.0,1.0,0,neutral,for 15 years i used microsoft money even after microsoft stopped supporting and selling the product  when my spouse started a new business and we had to track expenses in more detail i decided to upgrade to quickenwindows  i did not like it as much as ms money but a large part of the dissatisfaction was likely due to my extreme knowledge of ms money while having to learn about quickenwindows differences and idiosyncrasies  however we recently had to buy a new home computer and changed to an apple mac so we had to change to quickenapple  what a disappointment  the good news is that i was able to rather easily import all my past years data first from ms money to quickenwindows and then to quickenapple  but there is more negative to report than there is positive  there is significant functionality missing in the apple version of software compared to the windows version  a few examples  when viewing an account you can not limit the transaction views to the unreconciled ones or just the last few months transactions  the only option is to have the screen list every last transaction you ever made in that account  in my case that can be 10 years worth of data most of which i want to keep but not display at all times  reporting is very limited  a small number of stock reports are available and they can be modified and saved  but you can not export the report to a spreadsheet you can only print it out or save a pdf of the report  quicken help tells you that to export the data which makes up the report you have to manually export the raw data yourself and create your own report  not useful  and when you want help from quicken there is absolutely no phone or live support  everything is done through forums  feedback online  from what i read on quickens support forums and from my short experience so far quickenwindows is where most of quickens technical support  development goes they apparently have little interest or little desire to support the apple version in an equivalent manner  my suggestion is to stick to quickenwindows or find another vendor if you must use an apple environment,Digital_Software

got her notice a few days ago and i upgraded it friday night when she no longer needed it for workbr this experience was not as smooth the download was about 25gb and took a while after the lengthy download it started similarly to the first time noted in the original review then a box appeared that said something like please waitwere preparing for the upgrade so i waited and waited and waited finally i went to bed and found the pc in the same state the next morning something must have gone wrong trying to close with the x did nothing using rightclick and 34close34 on the task bar icon did nothing so i forced a shutdown using the onoff button and rebootedbr then the upgrade pretty much went on its own after another hour or two it restarted and its running ok i have not used it much and will further update with more experiencesbr br original reviewbr got my upgrade notice and immediately downloaded from microsoft and upgraded my surface pro 3 with itbr the upgrade experience was seamless the whole process took less than an hour with no intervention from the user except in the first few minutes to agree to the license agreement etc then the upgrade ran itself including restartingbr then we have to select express or custom setup the express setup essentially sends microsoft all the data it wants regarding your surfing habits location default apps for pictures and videos music etc i selected custom setup and picked and chose what i wanted to share again this was fast and painlessbr im using the edge browser on amazon to type this it loaded fast and has worked seamlessly so far however i cant find a way to use setting to specify my multiple start pages like all other browsers and have to add as custom pages one at a time irritatingbr i was also a tester for the preproduction versions this is based on my experience with them as wellbr the best thing is that windows is now equally touch and keyboardmouse friendly you can have it in tablet mode and maximize the square icons display you can also resize it to become a squarish start menu that occupies only the lower left corner of the display the difference is that it shows live feeds such as weather news and stock market indices its as mouse friendly as it is touch friendly nicebr i timed the start up it took about 12 seconds from pushing the power button on my surface pro 3 for the login screen to appear the wireless took about 15 seconds to connect to my wifi by the time i typed in my password its all good to go 20 seconds or less the fast start up of w8 was what prompted me to upgrade from w7 to w8 and im glad this was retainedbr there is a prominent search window next to the start icon where you can search without having to start a browserbr next to search is a task icon clicking it brings all open apps in tiles on the main screen its not gimmicky at all and very convenient to switch tasksbr so far everything works as when i was using w81 its as seamless as any windows upgrade that i had done no complaintsbr microsofts goal is to fix the defects of w8 without losing its advantages while adding goodies looks like they have hit the markbr ill keep on testing and will update

33885227,235293272,4.0,1.0,1.0,0,positive,i have tried several recipe organizers and this one is the best  there have been a couple of glitches but the staff is extremely responsive and answer the same day  they are also always updating their editions to fix problems  entering recipes is a pain but it is going to be so  i have collected cutout recipes for 25 years and pasted them into 2 large books  i tried the scanning method to enter them but that is nearly as timeconsuming as entering them by hand  i have made changes over the years or i like to give different instructions than those written  so it took me several weeks to enter my 400 recipes  i now have a copy of the program on my envy tabletpc couldnt easily find this so the help desk at dvo sent me a link and also the app on my android phone  it is super handy to be able to look up the ingredients of a certain recipe right on my phone while at the grocery or just at home making up menus  it is also easy to read from the tablet or phone while preparing the recipes in the kitchen  i have not had problems w the app crashing except at first on my husbands ipad  it eventually worked and no problems since  the main difficulty is syncing between all of those devices when i add new recipes  it can be done  i have found i need to close the desktop version so that it saves and backs up  then i close all of my apps on other devices  then open the desktop and press the cloudshaped sync button  then open each app and press the sync  after all that the recipes are all in the same places  but considering i dont intend to enter a bunch of new recipes in the future this is not a bad procedure  i have tried the menu planning and grocery list process  the instructions online are quite confusing  but once it gets going this is a very handy feature  i have been writing menus and grocery lists by hand for years so this will be helpful  the only complaint is that the pantry items like spices are listed on the grocery list  it would be super handy if you could mark off things you have on hand so that they would not appear in the list  my other suggestion would be that when entering recipes that some common instructions would somehow be available as dropdowns or something  i had to type minced chopped softened so many times that it drove me crazy  overall it is a great product  it is worth the investment of time and money  if you have problems contact the dvo people they are great,Digital_Software

38199669,8655796,1.0,2.0,2.0,0,negative,this is not a review of how effective norton is as security software  the score reflects the frustration i experienced in renewing my coverage and the horrible customer experience i had with their tech supportbr br i have purchased the software through amn for several years because norton always wanted to charge considerably more  but norton has now made it very difficult to install a new version when you have a prior version  the worst part came when i decided to call the tech support number on the page that would keep popping up whenever i did anything on the norton site  instant tech expert  i was expecting a simple help desk call with the tech just telling me how to find the screen where i could input the product code for my new software  instead i got a tech who wanted to get background info like my name address phone number  at that point i refused to provide any more personal information so he moved on to actually asking about my problem  he said that he could take control of my pc and help me directly  and that was fine i followed the instructions and loaded the iyogi software and gave him permission to take controlbr br but rather than helping me with the screen navigation he proceeded to explore and check out the software stack because something might be conflicting with norton  and of course he found software installed askcom that can be a problem  he had to query every title what is this quicken did you install it until i got a little testy and he moved on to asking to run a diagnostic part of the iyogi platform  it found registry errors the askcom software  34this is very bad it needs to be fixed34  and of course they could do that for me for a pricebr br at that point knowing that there are always registry errors and he couldnt tell me anything more about them and remembering that the askcom came when i was updating java but i never enabled it i decided that this was bogus  i askedif he was going drop this and help me install norton  as i had been asking about every 5 minutes and he said that it shouldnt be done until the security problems had been remediated  actually we went around in circles for about 5 minutes me saying we were done just install norton and he saying in various ways that he wasnt going to do that without the fixes being done first  i told him to remove iyogi which he did  and i ended the call  after 45 wasted minutesbr br i looked up iyogi later and the outfit was seen as legitimate tech support by some reviewers just not very competent and focused on 34upselling34 that cleansing service i refused  others called them scammers but at least no one said that they drop trojans without you knowing itbr br 2 hours later when i had a few minutes i tried again on my own  i started by creating a new account on the norton site rather than trying to use my existing one and in a few minutes figured out how to input the key download the new software remove the old and i was done  so im using the software i bought from amazon  i should have had a little more patience  but no thanks to norton  one of the worst customer experiences ive ever had  next year im shifting to a different product,Digital_Software

13016009,740213825,5.0,16.0,17.0,0,positive,im a hobbyist woodworker with a large format cnc router  ive been looking for a capable cadcam software package that i can legally use at home  i have used inventor for years and had a student license when i was in school  however now that i am a working stiff i cant honestly use that student license anymore  i spent months looking for software that i could reasonably afford that wouldnt cost me as much as my cnc machine to use  i found it in fusion 360  fusion 360 is a new kind of software platform for autodesk  rather than a pricey upfront cost strategy they are offering several subscription services ranging from free to currently 40mo or 300year  the free license is available to hobbyists and 34start ups34 which means you can use the software for free as long as you arent making a profit with it  if you do end up developing a product for sale you can roll into the 40mo or 300year subscription which is quite affordable even for the adventurous hobbyist like myself  as far as the software is concerned it is really quite good especially if you consider the price  it is not as convenient to use as something like inventor  it lacks hot keys and other powerful features like parts libraries  it also has a bit different kind of assembly methodology using 34joints34 rather than constraints  a joint is basically an automated way of doing 3 constraints at once which can be convenient but can be frustrating as well when you want to do more complex constraints  that said it is an exceedingly powerful software package  there is nothing better in the cad market for under 23k for the cad capabilities and absolutely nothing like it for under 48k on the cam side  it is a fully parametric fully direct modeling and fully tspline sculpting cam package with assembly capabilities as well as a model based integrated cam system  further it is a product that is growing in capability all the time  it may not be the perfect software for enterprise level work yet but for the hobbyist and small shop its more than enough especially at the price level of free  i do a lot of woodworking and this software is great for making technical and sculpted parts  however there are certain things i wish it did that i have been told are coming  1 vcarving this is nice for making lettering and signs  you can do embossing but making really good letters is not easy at the moment  2 part patterningnesting when you cut stuff out of sheet stock you really want to make the most of your materials  right now there is not an easy way to even pattern parts with the same cam operations  if you need multiple parts you either have to create a specialized gcode program with work offsets yourself or machine them one at a time  3 feeds and speeds calculator you need this to keep from breaking or burning up your bits  right now i use gwizzard by cnc cookbook  it would save time if fusion would do an even basic calculation to set these for you  because of these short comings this software is not ideal for cnc routers but ive been told that these things are coming so maybe i will revise my review to be a full 5 star review when these features are complete because then i would need no other software to do what ever i want   update  this morning i got an update of the software  there is now a cam patterning ability  maybe it was there before and i didnt notice it but i just found it this morning  that is a big plus  i have upgraded my review to 45 stars  i can live without a feeds and speeds calculator as i have one already but being able to pattern parts in sheet goods is huge  i hope they do a nesting feature too  if only they did vcarving i would be super happy  if they had a sculpting library available for relief carving i would be extatic  maybe this is coming too,Digital_Software

25379913,574904556,1.0,5.0,12.0,0,negative,i was so excited to get this antivirus software  i did all my research read all the reviews including the one on pcmag which gave webroot its editors choice award  then the minute i downloaded this software the nightmare beganbr br let me begin by saying that i wish i could crawl into a time machine and set the dial for the exact moment in time prior to my purchase of webroot  barring this no other way exists for me to ever retrieve the wasted hours of my life i spent dealing with this program  not to mention the time i am now spending writing this magnum opus painstakingly detailing my nightmarish journey  that time is gone forever  the only thing i can do is warn others of my experience  hopefully someone will benefit from my painbr br i strongly caution anyone against purchasing this program unless you have an extremely strong constitution coupled with the patience of mother theresa  if that is you i wish you godspeed  just dont neglect to gird your loins in preparation for the uphill battle that awaits youbr br computer slowdowns and frequent crashes  not long after downloading this program my computer slowed down and i noticed delays between my keyboard and mouse and my computer  my computer kept freezing up and i could not unfreeze it via the task manager because the cursor was frozen as well so i had to perform hard shutdowns  then i would reboot my computer and the same thing would happen again  although my computer six years old would occasionally freeze or stop responding after downloading webroot the change was profound  it was happening so often i could get nothing donebr br webroots response  i called webroot and spoke to an extremely surly tech who sounded like i had just awoken him from a nap  i had to ask him to speak up because he spoke in a barely audible mumble  that clearly conveyed i was inconveniencing him by my call  my questions would be met by absolute silence  not just the brief pause one would expect from someone preparing to deliver a thoughtful response  but more like the silence of the lambs  silences so profound and prolonged that i was forced to ask him if he were still on the line  he told me webroot wasnt the cause and that it must be my computer  following my conversation with him i did some online research and found lots of reviews by people who reported the same issue so it couldnt have just been my computer out of millions  too bad i hadnt done that beforehand instead of relying on the expertsbr br failed to block malicious program from downloading onto my computer  i went to a website that had free software and accidentally downloaded a program that turned out to be malware  i didnt intend to download this program  i may have inadvertently clicked on something  i dont know  but somehow it began downloading and running on my computer and i couldnt stop it  i went to the control panel and attempted to delete the program but it would not let me do so  instead it would ask me if i would allow it to make changes to my computer  i was forced to say yes hoping the changes it intended to make were to uninstall it but of course that wasnt the case  it probably just downloaded more crap and poured more and more malicious code onto my system  now mind you all this it did without so much as a murmur of protest from webroot  contrary to its own documentation available online which states that in the event webroot encounters a suspicious program it will prompt the user and warn against downloading anything from that site  barring that if webroot fails to block the virus or malicious program from breaching its security it is supposed to recognize and quarantine the program so that it doesnt then go on a rampage raping and pillaging everything in its path  in my case none of the above occurred  on the contrary the program downloaded without a hitch  afterwards my system began freezing and crashing like crazy  and if i thought things had been  bad before i was grossly mistaken  finally the problem was resolved by my operating system and not by webroot  my operating system intervened when i had booted it up for the umpteenth time and ran check disk  i watched as check disk ran and read what it was doing  it was deleting corrupt files and checking security descriptors  at one point through all of this webroot flashed a notice that it had removed  a threat  really webroot  not a moment too soon  like some fat lazy security guard who ambles onto the scene of a crime after a civilian bystander has taken down the thug  thanks a lotbr br webrootss response  webroot said that it cannot block all programs from downloading because people call them and complain that programs they specifically want to download are blockedbr br password manager problems from here to doomsday  first the password manager extension didnt appear on my toolbar  spoke to someone in tech support who was very nice and helped me to fix it  called again because i was trying to use the password manager and it wouldnt work with a lot of the websites i tried to save  initially i thought it was me because im not very computersavvy  so i went over everything with the tech who was also very nice and he walked me through everything until i was sure i understood how to use it  then when i tried working with it on my own i found out what a horrendous buggy program it is  i saved dozens of sites to the password manager that seemed to be working fine  then when i would later go and click on them webroot would react strangely sometimes taking me to the site and not filling in the login and password sometimes only filling in part of the password etc  i tried resaving the loginpassword info for these sites numerous times i literally spent hours doing this the password manager would say it detected a change in the password and when i clicked on confirm it would either just capture the first character of the new password or run okay but continue to prompt me that it detected a change in the password every time i logged onto that site  there were at also numerous sites that i couldnt even get the password manager to work with at all despite trying again and again ad nauseambr br webroots response  i was told by one person in salescustomer support that he used the password manager on his own computer all the time and that it worked great  he referred me to the online documentation which i assured him i had already read  by that point i was all too familiar with the ins and outs of the password manager feature  he still found this difficult to believe  next i spoke to tech support and was told basically the same thing that it could not be webroot that was at fault but that i must be doing something wrong  he said that webroot is the number one software on the market so i guess then it couldnt be them  i invited him to remotely access my computer and check it out for himself  when he did so he was surprised that indeed things werent working so great  he then proceeded to tell me it must be my computer that wasnt working well  i asked him what could possibly be happening on my computer that would cause an internet toolbar extension to malfunction  he threw  out a few ideas like maybe i had hardware issues or another program was interfering with the password manager  i invited him to look at my programs and see if he could find something that might be conflicting with webroot and he could not  note  afterwards i read reviews by others who were treated in like manner  apparently webroot has the attitude that its product is perfect and that if the user encounters problems with its software it must be their faultbr br attempt to get a refund  since i purchased this product on amazon i was unable to get a refundbecause of amazons policy  i told webroot that i wanted a refund from them and was told they couldnt do so because i hadnt purchased the product from them  but surely they had sold the product to amazon who then sold it to me right  so in essence they did sell me the program  at any rate i was so disgusted i just wanted to get rid of the damn thingbr br my last contact with webroot  i grew finally frustrated with one tech and asked to be connected to a supervisor  i waited and waited  the line rang and i thought the supervisor was going to pick up  instead i had been transferred to somebodys voicemail  i was livid  i talked to yet another tech and was again told i couldnt get a refund  after he had been dealing with me for awhile which granted could not have been pleasant by that point he threw out that i could just get a refund  when i said that i had been told that was not possible he insisted that it was  so conflicting information on top of everything else  at that point it was just the icing on the cake  he told me the my issues about the password manager would be escalated to another tech support department who would check on things from the back end  they were supposed to email me the results of their findings by today  as of this writing i have heard nothing from them except an email telling me they were going to look into it  great  i was told over the phone that they would have already looked into it by today and gotten back to me  buyer beware,Digital_Software

51667811,652127589,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,negative,ive used turbotax for over 2o years  2014 is the last year for me  for the past 10 years i have owned a rental property in a foreign country and have prepared my taxes using turbotax deluxe  this year i had to upgrade to the home and business version at a substantially higher price  strike one  when i started to input my data on the rental property turbotax software notified me that i had been claiming too much depreciation in past years and would have to file amended returns going back to 2010 as well as filing form 3115 requesting irs to allow me to change my depreciation method  wtf  i was relying on turbotax to choose the appropriate depreciation method since i had inputted the fact that the property is in a foreign country and also provided the canadian address  apparently turbotax has been miscalculating depreciation for the past 10 years despite the input data being correct  strike two  now i have to do a lot of refiling and may incur penalties and interest which i assume turbotax will pay but even if i am held harmless the amount of time and effort spent plus having to hire a cpa to fill out the form turbotax has not offered to provide any assistance with form 3115 nor to pay the cpas fee it is still going to cost me big time  strike three  i am not the only person that has been burned on this depreciation issue  the turbotax community website is filled with similar stories  my guess is that there will be a class action suit against intuit over this  they can count me in,Digital_Software

16924701,443781235,5.0,1.0,1.0,0,positive,go to the paragon web site and get the latest version of this software paragon migration os to ssd 4o english  my story how i wound up using this software great software  i got the 256 gig version of this adata ssdsolid state drive for my desk top computer once properly installed and operating it ran great and fasti ran parkdale speed test and it ran 10 times faster than my old hard drive hd strangely i saw no difference in the window index experience but the computer was noticeably running faster  this is my first rodeo with ssd but not with hds the first problem i ran into is that my computer oswidow vistadid not recognized this drive so it makes the acronis software difficult to run with this problem i went on youtube and found this is a basic problem with these ssd drives any brand anyway i went to youtube and watch this video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvj3zsenz4m80 the fellow on this video explained this problem with a samsung ssd drive and shows how to fix it by using the management features found on windows  once i got pass that i down located the free acronis software per the instructions that the adata gave well that downloaded software did not work i wasted about 3 hours trying to do that no dice i went to acronis website and down loaded the 14 day trial version of migration software it down loaded fine and the software worked fine without using any codes and such with the trial version i migrated my hd data to the ssd no problem  i used the 2nd hd slave space on my computer instead of the usb port to install the migrated data because i didnt have the cables and adapter to connect this ssd drive thru the usb port it copied my main hd drive in about 20 minutes sweet i was replacing a 500 gig drive with about 130 gigs of used space on it i was expecting the migration software to fail but it worked okay it transfer the data from larger gig size hd to the smaller gig sized ssd  it should not be that hard to do but it is hd memory have always been a pain to install so ssds are not any different i spend about 8 hours messing with this drive by going to researching different web siteswatching different youtube videos and just manipulating this drive the next installation should take about 20 minutes or more my suggestion to the adata manufacture is that they should provide the instruction with a detailed video on youtube for rookie like meshowing from unwrap to final operations including the drive manage features of window  anyway have fun i used an old computer i had to test this sdd to see how it worked it was worth the hassle i have other newer computers i need to install ssds it will be snap to do now that i understand the procedure next time i will buy a ssd that comes with a kit with usb cables included for migrating my lap top computer hd to the ssd asked the vender if this one should come with the usb cable adapter if you are upgrading your laptop or where you can get one  second purchase 8 months later this time for my computer with a os windows 7 and with a i000 gig hard drive i bought this same drive again because it works and i thought it was going to be a piece of cake how wrong i was the acronis software explained that it would require several boots to clone the drive so i let it do its thing it didnt work properly it copied the part with the operating system and finished there it did not boot several times only once so it finished there with 30 gig formatted on that drive i perform the same thing several times and the same thing happen i went to the manage part of windows and viewed the ssd and it was split in two different volumes messed with the volumes i later found out i should have just extended the volume to attach them together somehow i thought i had lost 18 gb of the ssd by messing with the volumes  so the ssd drive now has 238 shown in windows disk manger instead of 256 gb the bios still shows it has 238 gb this was strange so i check several help blogs in the internet and found this is a normal size memory that windows lets you see for a 256 ssd  the missing 18 gb is hidden doing some other work that the ssd needs to do so i decide to go with that size memory   i looked for another migration software and found one called paragon migrate os to ssd 40 english paragon some bad reviews on amazon but i decided to give it a shot it cost 20 buck for the password to unlock their down load i selected the 64 bit version and used that i installed that and used it it worked like a charm what i liked about this software is that it does not required you to reboot for the software to  do its thing a window appears and the progress is shown there it does its thing until it is complete no reboots until the work is completed  this is my main desktop computer and it works great now again 10 times faster this computer has a small power supply 220 watts i check the load to see how that was it normally draws about 77 watt at idle mode now with the ssd it is drawing  63 watts so it used about 14 watt less with use on different loads the 14 watts savings stay about the same  i found that the paragon migration performed a better job that acronisin fact windows perform excellent using this software the other computer that i used acronis the windows is a little unstable when it boots and during operations i lose windows every so offend it just a redundant old computer i have so its not that important to me it was having this problem on the original drive so it must have been an existing hardware or software problem i just used this computer as a test platform so its okay so mission accomplished on the second drive using paragon software  next  i will remount the first ssd i bought into my new laptop with windows

18396428,16665562,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,negative,after using quicken since it went on the market for windows and upgrading from time to time now finally to quicken 2015 for mac following quicken essentials i am disappointed quicken 2015 looks and acts too differentit is hard to start using especially to reconcile accounts out of the box compared to earlier versions is not as easy to navigate on the screen and does not display what i want to be looking at on the default displays and seems very unfamiliar at least initially i am glad i did not delete the previous version after converting i have been running it in parallel with quicken essentials for two months after converting the essentials file and im i still not comfortable with it  i have to admit that the file conversion was easy but using the new program for simple familiar things is not i do not use the program to its max and im certainly not a power user primarily i use it for recordkeeping and maintaining account balances for accounts paid by different methods thats reliable and portable and easy to use most previous quicken versions in windows and mac were comparatively easy use from the outset but each new update got  progressively more difficult i hate that trend what i like about mac 34apple34 stuff is that they dont stick you with profoundly different feeling and functioning software update there are other mac financial programs out there that do the basics sorry i didnt check it out before purchasing quicken 2015 but you should if i had the opportunity to do it over id stay with quicken essentials while checking out other options imho the upgrade is not much of an upgrade,Digital_Software

15545523,925385625,5.0,0.0,0.0,0,positive,i have been using quicken and quickbooks for many years and i think quicken is the best personal money management software out there  you can customize items for sorting  i use it for rental properties their rental property software is lousy in my opinion but you can use the various information fields for different rental properties and it works very well  i wish that the predictive text would only predict entries in each account rather than predicting entries from another account  i have about a dozen rental property accounts to manage and the predictive text often predicts an item appropriate only to a different account when downloading from the bank  i especially like the new feature of being able to preload reminders for bills as the insurance bills for the various properties come in at odd times and keeping track of them has been difficult to do manually  i dont think this was in the earlier version i had  been usingbr br the reporting function takes some getting used to as the filters sometimes are confusing but once you get used to setting up a report you can reuse the report year after year by simply changing the date range  this is a nice feature in my view especially at tax time  it has a lot of goodies for helping with income tax but i dont use them  they may be a help to many though  not sure  but the reporting function and the ability to customize the reports is very usefulbr br i also use the software for managing personal finances  all the goodies for budget etc are useless to me but they dont hamper using the basic functions which is really a good thing as many other software companies add features that make the basic functions more difficult to use  intuit does not  if you are left brained it is great software  if you are right brained as my wife is the predictive text problem is vexing for her  but i am writing the review and i like the product,Digital_Software

40268673,625745891,4.0,2.0,2.0,0,positive,i recently bought prodads video speed modifying software 34respeedr34 to try slowmotion with video i knew from samples i had seen that there were likely to be picture artifacts with this software and also with a more expensive alternative 34twixtor34 but it appeared that with care and with some subjects results could be at least adequate but my first attempts with speed changes of 12x 14x 110x 2x 4x and 10x with a difficult video clip were poor and they indicated that the best results were likely to be with subjects that moved against plain or at least out of focus surrounding areas did not move rapidly through the frame and did not intersect the frame edges this unfortunately precluded the use of some subject material that i was looking forward to rendering in slowmotion i then tried using sony vegas to render 60p footage as 30p slowing it with the 34velocity34 control to halfspeed this worked fairly well but i was looking for greater speed changes on a whim i tried placing the vegas 50slowed video clip which had a considerable amount of fine detail in it and which also had things passing in front of and behind other things on the respeedr timeline i set the speed control in respeedr for 14 speed for a total speedchange factor of 8 between the two programs i did not expect much  but i was quite surprised by the final outcome shown on youtube in respeedr i had set the speed to 342534 the 34subframe mode34 to 34opticalflow34 with 34stabilize34 selected with 34rollingshutter compensation34 deselected and with 34use of original frame rate34 29970fps selected and hit 34start34 the resulting clip showed slight anomalies at the extreme frame edges and in a surprisingly minor way with things passing near other things but overall the results were very good i then put the clip back into vegas and stabilized it again there at 341034 which further smoothed the motion and it also trimmed off the extreme picture edges 34cleaning34 those of artifacts  with a result that retains a considerable level of fine detail in the video although this is somewhat spoiled by the further compression and transcoding necessary for practical streaming on youtube some 34curious34 artifacting still remains  but at the level at which it exists here i do not find it objectionable the original was shot with a panasonic g5 several panasonic mft cameras produce very sharp video with a rokinon 75mm 34fisheye34 lens handheld without the aid of braces or handles i later tried shooting a test using 4k video shot with a panasonic gh4 at 30fps and this also worked well when stabilized slightly cropped and then reduced to 108030p in vegas this is also on youtube  search my name there to find these samples overall im pleased with what i can achieve using respeedr in combination with other programs  although processing time when using the highest quality settings can be rather lengthy even with the use of a very fast computer also this program is very easy and intuitive to use a big plus for me i recommend it especially given its moderate price and potentially very good resultsbr dr,Digital_Software

development costs have to be minimal as the basic product itself hasnt changed substantially in years in todays world of free and nearly free apps for our phones and tablets it is hard to justify why quicken costs as much as it doesbr br if you have used quicken previously there is precious little reason to consider an upgrade more often than every 10 years or so and then you are better off just buying a new fullretail version from amazon or any other reseller rather than get a product update from quicken at a cost thats actually more than buying the full version anywhere elsebr br when buying quicken you are faced with an array of different versions hint most of the functionality is the same in all of the versions with only a few relatively minor tweaks to customize them for different user preferences it is critically important for you to realize that the starter version is for first time users only you cannot import data from any other quicken version  you can only start a new file from scratchbr br i downloaded quicken 2015 kicking and screaming because i had to not because i wanted to i was perfectly happy with the much cursed and maligned 2013 version that finally was patched to the point of being okay and after doing a clean restore of my computer in anticipation of win10 coming i found out that my 2013 disk was misplaced  likely accidentally included in a batch of stuff i had shredded recently knowing that quicken comes out with their new version every year in september i hated the thought of paying full retail price in july for last years version 2015 i wouldnt have bought any new version so soon if i still had 2013 available to use and quicken being quicken i wasnt able to use my backup files with the older 2011 version i still hadbr br after installing 2015 deluxe i can safely say i could not find one tangible change from the 2013 version i had been using this is not just an unsubstantiated comment i am very much a quicken expert i bought version 1 on a 525 floppy disk directly from the original developer when it was first invented and i have used it nonstop since thenbr br my install of 2015 should have gone smoothly but no while they havent done much to change it they have done some subtle tweaks that ranged for me from minor irritations to some loud grrrr moments the minor irritation came from version 2015 making the process of linking to my bank account to download transactions more complicated i have no idea why but what used to be a onestep process took me almost 2 hours to set up and get working because it kept telling me my password was wrong the same password it just accepted seconds earlier it said it would send me an email to reset the password but after trying several times they never sent the email then they said that my bank locked me out after repeated attempts my bank told me that was impossible that the problem was with quicken i then bypassed quickens supersecure bulletproof password safety features at the push of one button something that a 98 yearold grandma hacker could do in 3 seconds and steal all of my data and bingo i was inbr br the major frustration though came from some unknown reason that quicken didnt just download my banks transactions from the date i last used it but instead felt it had to go back and redownload things that had already cleared and rename them in doing so it left me with numerous duplicate entries and a lot of items lumped together with the same dates as in several direct deposits from one source all dated the same day what that did is left a whole series of red entries that shows as overdrafts they never were of course but it made a mess of my meticulously maintained checkbook register that i had to go back over a 6month period and reenter manually itembyitem using my banks statements it left a taste of what so many people have accused quicken programmers of  living in dark cubicles never using the product themselves in real life and having no clue the effects their little tweaks were havingbr br i cant downrate quicken for me losing my 2013 version and having to buy a new one or the fact that when 2016 comes out i wont get a discount after only getting a couple of months use out of 2015 but i can downrate it because i didnt get anything better than i already had and the fact that the few minor tweaks they did do make my life harder not easierer a 6month period and reenter manually itembyitem using my banks statements it left a taste of what so many people have accused quicken programmers of  living in dark cubicles never using the

31177587,16665562,2.0,2.0,3.0,0,negative,there is no good personal finance package for a mac  ive tried ibank 553 gnucash for mac 266 moneydance 20155 acemoney 4361 and now quicken for mac 2015  each is unsatisfactory in its own way  this review applies to quicken for mac 2015 version 250 with some comments about comparable programs  the best thing about quicken for mac is that export of quicken windows data via a windowsbased addon exporter works reasonably well  not all data can be imported into the quicken for mac 2015 because it simply doesnt support the same feature set but id rate the process as very good on the average  the import process is almost as fast as moneydance much faster than gnucash and much much faster than ibank which takes many hours to import the same data that other programs import in minutes  after import quicken for mac balances are mostly accurate which cant be said for some other programs  speaking of keeping account balances correct the basic function of a personal finance package is to balance your checkbook and other accounts  how hard could that be  well much got lost in redesigning quicken windows into a quicken for mac and 34reconcile to online balance34 and 34reconcile shares34 functionality is gone  instead you get to manually enter starting and ending balance from printed statements then reconcile transactions between those two dates  only cash not shares  and thats even for online accounts downloaded by quicken for mac  unfortunately thats not a quick way to balance your checkbook  why is a sensible reconciliation feature missing on the mac version while the windows version has it  its a mystery along with many other mysteries  for example quicken for mac can export transactions as csv but then cant import its own exported csv file  who comes up with design specifications like that  another mystery a brokerage account has a cash balance but when asked quicken for mac claims that the34online balance34 is zero in the 34transactions34 view  yet shows it as 34available cash34 under the 34portfolio34 view  thats a bit schizophrenic  others have pointed out that quicken for mac falls short in many areas particularly reporting when compared to the windows version  however the windows version running within a virtual pc on the fastest mac became excruciatingly slow over the years  every transaction edit results in 5 seconds of internal updates before anything else can be done  something is badly engineered in the windows version  quicken for mac working on the same data is quite responsive perhaps thanks to internal improvements  these are two very very different programs even though they both say 34quicken34  in summary quicken for mac 2015 is not terrible but it isnt very good either  it works in a limited way but some basics like support for reconciling cash and shares to online balances are not there resulting in much manual labor compared to the quicken for windows  on the positive side quicken for mac is reasonably responsive while quicken for windows became painfully slow running within a virtual machine on even the fastest mac  intuit needs to improve this program  the competition isnt much better but others are gradually improving their offerings  update quicken for mac 2015 or 2016 does not work with t rowe price retirement accounts although brokerage accounts should work  trp offers no solutions for this  also as of late 2015 importing an ofx or qfx file downloaded from a bank which uses this method can fail if quicken for mac decides that the financial institution has not signed up with intuit this is beyond bad  intuit has no business being in the middle of bankcustomer data downloads  this raises concerns about whether intuit is aggregating information about quicken users financial connections which creates a huge security vulnerability  for this reason im downgrading quicken for mac to only two stars,Digital_Software

31177587,192861724,2.0,5.0,6.0,0,negative,the infinite kind developers must have done something right because moneydance imports data quickly and feels responsive in normal use  the same data in quicken deluxe on windows shows a spinning wheel for 5 seconds on every transaction entry in ibank 5 on a mac the import process takes 60 times longer than moneydance  those are the reasons that made me buy the program  however the main purpose of a personal finance manager is to track your accounts and thats where moneydance 20155 fails dismally  it simply cannot track what bank downloads say  moneydances idea of account balance is the initial balance plus transactions this can easily get out of whack but moneydance wont even tell you that there is a problem let alone help you fix it  youll need to log into each account separately note balances reported by your bank or brokerage then verify that they match moneydance reported balances perhaps weekly  this is not what i expected  the problem is made worse if you own securities manual tracking of balance discrepancies and manual fixes are needed for every accountsecurity combination separately  this is worse than balancing a checkbook based on paper bank statements  as of 2015 moneydance isnt capable of helping you track account cash and security balances for your online accounts  so im going back to my old quicken for windows  its slow but at least it performs its prime function reasonably well  quicken for mac 2015 doesnt  update moneydance will report various account balances if you click on 34balance 34 at the bottom right of an account screen eg for checking this might be balance cleared balance current balance confirmed balance unconfirmed balance and ledger total  from there you are on your own,Digital_Software

52503194,83475114,2.0,6.0,6.0,0,negative,my quicken data file got corrupted so im starting a new one while keeping the old one limping along until the end of this year i had longsincereconciled transactions disappearing on me and many annoyances isnt it yet another example of why a monopoly is usually bad   anyway i got to try some of the 34lets get started34 features of the program which ive not used in years and years id like to say something positive but this software makes me so cranky and irritable  one major annoyance at least for me is that the default settings make for a lot of extra work on my part while i was setting up my new quicken file starting from zero the software would connect with the bank or the credit card issuer and it was downloading the last 90 days of transactions and automatically accepting them and autocategorizing them 90 wrong so in other words after it downloads all this it presents me with register after register of transactions hundreds of them all of which need to be reviewededited one by one what could be wrong with having the software ask the user 34do you want me to automatically download and categorize everything i can find when i connect to this site34 how hard is that  you may wonder to yourself why didnt you just go into the preferences and toggle that 34autodownloadauto categorize34 feature off well one of the downsides of using the program a certain way for years and years is that you have it set the way you want it and the last time you dug around in the preferencesoptions was five or ten years ago kind of dumb yes but i can say the same to intuit  they should have an option that allows one to have the data file validated on a regular schedule that would save some folks a lot of grief      upgraded from quicken premier 2014 as with many reviewers i am a longtime user in my case since 1999  on the whole the software is more or less functional at trackingthe stuff most people track paychecks coming in have you scheduled that credit card payment how are we doing with our budget how much has that etf investment appreciated and so forth  there are daytoday operations which dont seem to be stable i typically download transactions once each day just to keep tabs on whats happening and this crucial operation is very unstable i have no idea what the root cause is but we have a fast reliable internet connection cable modem 100mbps down and every day there is at least one or two downloads that generate errors most of these are transient ie attempt the download again and you often see different errors i cant recall any past versions of quicken that were as unstable in this way i do have a decent number of accounts to download more than 20 lets say but its not uncommon for me to do a download and get somewhere from 25 transient error messages 34suchandsuch an account couldnt download because there was error xyz34 repeat the download and sometimes some errors disappear and sometimes not its so unpredictable  other oddball errors have happened transactions disappear long after being reconciled the software cant remember payee accounts that have been used many times and so on  in a word this software never gets polished and never functions as well as one might expect given the price and the pressure to upgrade frequently its so unfortunate that there are no real competitor products  i upgraded from q2014 premier because that software contained one very frustrating bug which prevented one from changing certain transactions if you made a mistake with any kind of irarelated transaction a download accepted into the wrong account for example you could not delete or change the transaction it became clear that intuit was never going to fix that for q2014 when they announced the new features for q2015 so i cursed them and plopped down my money for q2015  regarding the mobile app i installed it on my iphone and tried using it i entered all my transactions while on a trip using the mobile app when i came home and downloaded all of my inputs quicken created a duplicate account for one credit card and filled it with duplicate transactions after cleaning up the mess i stopped using the mobile app as it was causing more problems than it solved  clearly there is plenty of room for improvement and intuit superficial replies to negative reviews notwithstanding seems to have little interest in substantive improvement  i would like to see a truly polished functional product with a reasonable annual subscription fee i always maintain that one should never attribute malice when stupidity or other explanations will suffice so i am not attributing malice to intuit rather their monopoly on this corner of the market has made them lazy and unresponsive to customer needs thats why the majority of reviews here are 3 stars and below,Digital_Software

11035555,499206730,4.0,4.0,5.0,0,positive,ive found this software to be more than adequate for editing my photography which is a hobby of mine that ive had for a few years now im certain that there are other programs that are 34better34 in some aspects but paintshop has been the most advanced program i have invested in thus far previously i was using smart photo editor because of its very low pricing but the overall quality of a finished product was really no good even when maximizing the quality of the image based on its provided scale it would be less than pristine and i was not settling for that even after purchasing this i continue to use portraitpro 12 for all of my fashion or model based photography now allow me to break down this software for you a little so you can get a better understanding of how it worksbr there are three main tabs at the top of the opened software page manage adjust edit each of which i will highlight and give a pros and cons rundown ofbr managebr this tab allows you to 34quickly34 search through the folders of your computer in order to select the right photograph or group of photographs for editingbr pros br 1 there are thumbnails that give you a preview in the center of the screen after you open up a particular folder that allows you to quickly preview the photographs in the albumbr 2 the right side of my set up i have the info widget that gives you a detail rundown of the file properties and the camera data that goes along with it this is very helpful when considering maximum file size for site uploads before editingbr 3 the bottom left of my screen i have a preview widget with helps me to determine which specific shot i am looking at if i took multiple of the same thingbr cons br 1 really the only con to this tab is the navigation widget because it isnt the best organized and its ultimately easier in my opinion to go through the file explorer on my computer to select the image i want to openbradjustbr this tab gives you the basics of photo editing so you can quickly adjust and modify an image to your liking i would recommend starting with editing mostly from this tab and familiarizing yourself with it before moving on to the edit tab so that once you are aware of the particular functions each part has in this one you will be able to better understand the nextbr prosbr 1 this is definitely a very simple interface and really the only basic essentials you would need to get the job donebr 2 the adjust widget has a breakdown of all your tools like cropping straightening there is also the 34smart photo fix34 that has sliders like brightness saturation etc it also contains other sections like white balance digital noise removal etc easy to navigate and the changes are quickly analyzed and previewedbr 3 the center of the screen has the preview of the image you are working on and it modifies the appearance as you are working on itbr 4 the tool bars and organizer widget give you a quick rundown of saving file options rotation a preview of other items in the folder and other helpful devicesbr cons br 1 try to keep in mind that this is the simple part of the editing this software provides its all the essentials so youll feel comfortable with this tab but leaving it is very hard it puts you in a comfort zone and its very hard to leave for some people this could be a serious issuebr 2 the worst part about this tab is the 34instant effects34 widget they are all poor options in my opinion none of them really give any sort of satisfaction that the work youre doing is going to look good if you use them just my opinion so take that as you may the only plus side to this widget is that there is a preview of how badly youre screwing up your image with using it but the preview is small so once you double click with confidence dont be surprised when you ctrlzbr editbr this is your in depth editing just about anything and everything you can imagine can be done on this tab once you have it figured outbr prosbr 1 the organizer widget at the bottom of the page and the preview in the center have migrated from the adjust tab into this one which gives the user a sense of familiarity once you make the transition over to this tabbr 2 the tools thrown around on this page are either labeled or have an image that gives a pretty clear assumption as to what they dobr 3 34learning center34 which the best thing ever for someone just getting used to using this software it gives you a breakdown of each tool and widget and you name it you will need this you will love this you are welcomebr consbr i dont feel like listing all this out is the most effective way to give you an understanding of the cons of this tab they can be taken as pros by some people but for me i find them negative the tool bar at the top of the page has a drop down menu that gives you different names of what you might be looking for its unnecessary just use the learning center the materials widget and the layers widget are unclear to me for exactly what they are trying to do i feel like gimp has a clearer representation of what you can do using these tools and its free so you should consider getting it if youll need layering overall the interface of this tab is not the most user friendly and it can be a real pain to use once you get the hang of it this can be a photographers best friendbr br overall opinionbr for the price its a great investment it will definitely do everything you need as a hobbyist and even if you become a little more professional with your work youll find this to be useful and a great tool to have i like it it isnt the easiest to use at first but give it time and try learning something and it will pay off,Digital_Software

52826210,109813655,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,negative,this software is a huge step backwards  i started with quicken in 1992  23 years ago  i use it predominantly to write and print checks for my employers five accounts  i managed to hold off ditching quicken 2006 for years but when i replaced my computer i had no choice but to upgrade to quicken 2014  i used to actually enjoy 34accounts payable batch34 days  it was a vicarious thrill to spend gobs of money and whip out 150 checks in short order  now i dread it  earlier versions remembered the most recent check written to a payee  i could immediately tell if i was entering a check already paid sometimes checks and invoices cross in the mail  this version only remembers the last time i 34memorized34 a payee  so lets say i memorize a check to abc in january  i write a check to abc every month thereafter  in every subsequent month  quicken will still be autofilling the january information rather than the previous months information like earlier versions of quicken did  quicken 2014 is riddled with these little annoyances  in the check writing pane when i move from one account to another it invariably stops me with the query 34save last transaction34  if i press 34yes34 it saves a blank check  if i press 34no34 it allows me to continue  since i am jamming through a blizzard of bills this distraction ticks me off  the interface with my printer leaves a lot to be desired and the ability to customize reports is weaker than any version of quicken i have ever used  im using a mac and running parallels with windows 7 so that i can have my quicken the quicken for mac was such a holyhell mess that i gave up on it after a mere two frustrating weeks  i give it two stars because at the end of the day it does function  however i now spend a lot of time researching other check writing software hoping to find something better  with quickens descent into terrible mediocrity i expect that something better willbe along soon  im so disappointed that a once spectacular software has degenerated into this clunky userhostile piece of junk,Digital_Software

452646,190848920,4.0,0.0,0.0,0,positive,rpg maker 2003 is a much older version of the software that has only just recently been translated and localized in the years since many have seen and used the later versions of xp vx and vx ace i have personally spent hours upon hours trying to make even the tiniest of games and there is always this wall that comes up blocking further progress this was generally due to either a lack of more ideas or complete hard drive crashes and the loss of databr br though with the availability of massive costeffective hard drives the latter has not been much of a problem these last few years so when someone honestly says oh you just made that using rpg maker they generally have no real idea of how much time and effort still needs to go into making such a project the time building the environments the time scripting events and cutscenes and the time getting combat just right to not have it too easy too hard or just plain boring all of this is even before getting into the more custom sprite making music and battle systemsbr br before getting into details the most important factor is to understand the manner in which rpg maker 2003 is designed any game rpg action rpg action platformer you name it has three distinct layers each of these layers have their own specific use and must be designed accordingly if the final project is to succeedbr br the first layer works like the ground as it defines where the eventual player can or cannot move straight paths winding corridors walls or no walls to define these paths that is your choice to make the layer above this one is where a user can throw in obstacles and decorations such as beds chairs barrels statues and other fun stuff to make players move around the final layer is perhaps the most or least important depending upon how you see it this is where users can enter script for events cutscenes transitions change random battles for on screen enemy battles that you run into and so onbr br the interface in rpg maker 2003 is simple and clean which is a staple of the rpg maker series just about any required tool or option can be found either on the left side of the window with the available tileset or all along the upper taskbar leaving the majority of the window for the user to design their adventure the tilesets take up about a quarter of the left side of the screen along with the projects name and area maps which are all easily accessible with a simple click of the mouse the maps can be easily draggedanddropped as needed or even put under another one which indents it in the list to show the user or another collaborator that those maps are part of the one above itbr br moving on to much more fun things than the interface comes the actual construction of the game i will be honest and say that anyone that has ever used ms paint or adobes photoshop will find themselves right at home with the following optionsbr   the pen tool to draw tiles one click at a timebr   the rectangle tool form a rectangle of the selected choicesbr   the oval tool which is like the rectangle but more circular and finallybr   the fill tool that will fill up any space that is attached to itbr br while the above might not sound like a lot of available options they get the job done rather quickly and efficiently some of you by this point may have realized that i never said that there was an eraser to remove anything that was unwanted and this because instead of being part of the selection tools is instead part of the tilesets unfortunately this means that the eraser can change places depending upon which level of the tilesets you are looking at it would have been nice to have a dedicated eraser tool but at the very least there still is an option for itbr br after you initially build your first environments which will be an ongoing process because it is never really finished as there is alwaysgoing to be that one last thing that you will want to add or modify comes the placing of events because i could literally be here until next week writing about what events can do i will try to keep it brief but feel free to comment below for more informationbr br events are multifaceted and exist to make everything work from more than just moving around the map these control possibilities and absolutes from allowing a player to move into a house from the village into a field or a cave fight an encounter as long as they have talked to town persons abc and walked around the well three times counterclockwise to no longer being able to enter a shop because you irritated the owner all of these options and more can be set within one event square with commands that can be input into a window from a series of available choicesbr br to say that there are a lot of options would be an understatement unlike the vx ace version that i recently used the rpg maker 2003 does not have sections that break up the options under headers to make them easy to find this could create a bit of a challenge when trying to remember which option was on which tab and how far down the page it was while this is not the end of the world it could certainly make the things much more timeconsuming there are a few items that could have been updated for the rerelease such as the ability to set the face graphic while inputting the text instead of having them both as separate actions which can really fill out the contents window very fastbr br rpg maker 2003 event windows compared to rpg maker vx acebr br these really are only minor details but they are minor details that do add up over time but in regards to how much time has been spent and sometimes into how frustrated you can become before really needing to take a break from the projectbr br the final gear that makes everything work is the database this acts as the central storage unit for every ounce of data from your characters and enemies to animations and tilesets in here just about any modification can be done a perfect example would be for anyone whos playing final fantasy iv when cecil goes from being a dark knight to a paladin this would have been two separate entries in the database with an event handler that would switch over his sprite his experience and level his base stats and his equipment the moment he defeats his darker selfbr br rpg maker 2003 is a great software that is rather easy to

52656439,574904556,2.0,2.0,2.0,0,negative,in my small business ive been depending on secureanywhere complete for several years and im marginally satisfied at best  i know that it has saved me from malware intrusions many times because it pops up a dramatic warning when that happens  on the other hand about once every other week when i come into my office in the morning secureanywhere tells me that something called the 34morto trojan34 has appeared on my hard drive  secureanywhere seems to clean up that infection without letting it do any damage but nevertheless it allows the same malware to reappear again and again  the more serious deficiency of secureanywhere is however its automatic cloud backup feature  to begin with setting up a backup schedule is infuriatingly counterintuitive  then its very hard to determine if the backups are working as intended  for example in internet explorer secureanywheres yellow dot on a file name can mean 34this file is not yet backed up34 but it can also mean 34this file is backed up identically from more than one folder34  when my hard disk crashed and i went to restore my files from the cloud i found that secureanywhere had stopped making backups of my outlook folders several months earlier and i had lost everything from the intervening weeks  im motivated to write this review today because i just checked the backups of my outlook folders to ensure that theyre okay and i found that secureanywhere has again cancelled my daily scheduled backup without notifying me  im going to have to look at other security packages  addendum  as soon as amazon published this review of secureanywhere the manufacturer commented on it and invited me to contact webroot support for help in resolving my problems  the support team did respond promptly and they did resolve my immediate problem  after that however i asked how i can ensure that secureanywhere doesnt turn off my backups again without notifying me  in response the webrootsupport team told me how to check the activity log to determine if secureanywhere is in fact working  they summarized their recommendations as follows  34each back up sic software has different strengths and weaknesses and most require the user interaction sic to ensure that they are working correctly34  ill let that reply speak for itself  addendum 2  a year later i still have to check secureanywhere every morning to see if it has backed up my new files overnight  its not at all unusual for me to find that it has not  whenever i see that my new files are unprotected the 34backup  sync34 tab of the secureanywhere control panel  shows that backup and sync are both inexplicably turned off  rebooting the computer seems to resolve the problem  until it happens again usually within about a week  the antimalware features of secureanywhere have been effective but this huge flaw in the backup feature is totally unacceptable  addendum 3  i give up  every morning secureanywhere reports that it ran my backups as scheduled during the night but when i look at the backup copies that are available for restoration from the cloud theyre often two weeks out of date  a support person instructed me to uninstall and reinstall secureanywhere which did get the backups working again for a few days until everything returned to what is apparently normal   confident but completely false assurances  on my most recent call the support person told me that secureanywhere is an antivirus package not a backup package and i would probably be happier with dedicated backup software  i thanked him for an honest answer,Digital_Software

52003707,243284418,3.0,31.0,32.0,0,neutral,ive amended my review of version 8 to apply to version 9  i see that reviews for this program fall into two categories 1 wow so this is how screenplays are supposed to look  this program automatically formats them  awesome  i can write screenplays now and make movies 2 i have to use this program for a living and this program is no more glamorous to me than a plow is to a farmer  i fall into the latter category  although i envy beginners their enthusiasm for formatting and begrudge them none of their excitement at entering the world of screenwriting  that phase doesnt last more than a few months  if youre a professional screenwriter especially for tv then you pretty much have to use this program until someone comes out with something better that fulfills all the professional requirements needed by tv and film production companies  sad but true  sad because since this is a business of art it would be nice to have a really elegant program upon which to ply said art  but fd gets the job done  final draft support has been spotty over the last twenty years ive been using it sometimes good frequently not  they are quite a small company and management has not always been 34peopleoriented34 shall we say  many a show i work mostly in tv has suffered through innumerable glitches and crashes over the years and there are still  even at version 9  some oddly persistent problems  nonstandard mac interface for example pressing the command and the  keys simultaneously should select preferences like every other mac program it does not  still has many pagination bugs  still has display issues that corrupt the display of the script occasionally  nonintuitive interface that feels rather windows 95 instead of mac os x  bugs in the revision mode presets  inability to set certain defaults in a new script such as making character name follow dialogue automatically  instead you must reset this every time you makea new script  for some reason the programmers think an action line follows every piece of dialogue in every script  company resources spent making useless features like speaking your script out loud and using index cards instead of fixing bugs  thesaurus is still barebones not a big deal since you know the internet  spellcheck is sloooooow if you type moderately fast it wont flag misspells till youre a sentence or two past it  the 34feature34 called collabowriter that supposedly lets you collaborate online with a distant partner was nonfunctional so they removed it  it has never worked in the real world  btw it doesnt work on movie magic screenwriter either  do a google search and you will find that not one single reviewer or user has ever managed to get this 34feature34 to work   a colleague just showed me how to collaborate over the internet use skype  do a video call and then check the little box that says 34share screen34 and your partner can see your entire screen as you type  this is awesome and works very well so not having collabowriter is no biggie  it be nice to have a default zoom level and window positioning on the screen so that scripts dont open up all over the place and at different sizes  here are features that are either useless or annoying to professionals  texttospeech speaking your script out loud this is a pretty risible feature  writing management and statistics  watermark your script  this one is laughable  the sure sign of an amateur is the fear that someone will steal their script sorry also dont put your wga registration number or copyright number on your script another sign of an amateur  full screen mode  seriously  i know it sounds like im being harsh but they couldve used the resourcestime spent making the above useless features to fix bugs  sorry for the shouting   new features that professionals will probably never use  script notes enhancements script notes are a pain you have to click on that stupid little box only one writer i know uses them and we wont read them in her scripts if she does but whatever works for you  character highlighting at tables reads the scripts are printed out as hard copy so the colors are a bad idea some actors highlight some dont  neutral features  revision colors  havent used that so i dont know if its useful  scene navigator and character navigator i think they add nothing but i could see how someone might find them useful  great new features  replace character names globally  i know only one great new feature not promising  they are a small company and they dont sell millions of copies of this software so i think they make the bulk of their money by selling upgrades to new versions  theyre not making enough to have a big customer service department and the quality of that service has gone up and down over the years at least now someone from the company is replying to amazon review complaints  the number of professional screenwriters numbers in the thousands perhaps tens of thousands at best so they need amateurs and the curious to buy fd to stay in business amateurs and the curious can turn into professionals so this is a good thing imo so i forgive them their pandering to that market  we were all beginners once  i pointed out a few bugs in a previous version 6x on the phone with the head of the company and he told me and i quote 34yeah were not fixing those34 true to his word its 3 versions later and he has not fixed them  he didnt even have the decency to lie to me and say hed address in in a future incremental upgrade  you know in hollywood when you dont care enough to lie  thats bad news  he also made on odd confession to me he said 34you know we dont sell nearly as many copies of this as people think we do34  hmmmthat explains a lot he was on a podcast recently and he kept talking about the 3440 people at his company who work hard every day to make this program great34  40 people  holy dog doo thats a lot of people ignoring bugs i wouldnt brag about that man  anyway version 8 and 9 for mac works pretty well these days and ive had none of the fatal crashes and bugs of yesteryear  and you also cant blame us writers for holding residual grudges for all the times weve gotten burned in the past by this program  writing is damned difficult and when the actual software gets in the way its a ready target for our frustrations that may be stemming from the writing process itself  anyway if youre a professional you have to use this if youre in the studionetwork tv system and you already know it no matter what any review says  unless you dont need compatibility with a production company if youre not a professional yet but you really want to be someday you may as well learn its quirks now  that way you can suffer along with the rest of us  bottom line it works  it aint elegant but it works and its solid these days  i havent had a crash in several years  ive had pagination bugs and corrupted scripts but no crashes  which reminds me  save your script after every few lines  commands on the mac  i do it like breathing now because otherwise sadness will occur when files are damaged  which is rare  but it happens  when they update the interface and address current bugs ill upgrade my review to 5 stars  but for now they get 3  they lose stars for 18 years of frustration and failing to address current bugs  but they gain some for finally being stable otherwise id give them a one  the pagination spellcheck and revision mode bugs are the most annoying and persistent these are the ones that annoy every writer every day if they fixed these it would go a long way towards making happy users instead of begrudging users  footnote im writing this review as a professional screenwriter for better or worse  for those just starting or contemplating starting a writing career software is the least of your concerns  dont obsess about it  no software in the world is going to make you a writer  no book is going to make you a writer  no stupid courseseminarretreat is going to make you a writer go get celtx a free screenwriting program and see how you like this writing thing  if you love writing and like your work then go buy fd  its a decent enough plow  heres the best screenwriting advice i can give you find your own voice dont try to fit in be original youll feel better and get hired more and be rewarded by the industry  unless you want to be a tv hack and turn out csi episodes then please suppress any originality  on the upside the check from csi will always clear and youll have a very nice car  happy

36290437,16665562,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,negative,at least intuit is consistent that is consistent in undershooting the mark why why why for example does intuit insist on forcing the brokerage structure on users the problem with the brokerage structure is that every active investment from a particular institution is conflated into a single account these account entries are hard enough to read as it is its the equivalent of giving the user data reports only after the reports have been processed through a shredder and then through a shakeandbake baggiebr br another downside to this choice is that if you have several accounts at one institution you can only download into one of those accounts then of course you have to go through and delete data from all the other accounts to clean up the one account and then you have the pleasurable task of manually keying in the data for all the other accountsbr br and whats the deal with 34market value34 seems it should be a fairly straightforward math problem  of shares x current market price that formula works only if you dont make 34dividend income34 entries with your 34reinvest dividend34 entries how is a user supposed to make use of the 34dividend income34 report if there is no dividend income enteredbr br and same as previous incarnations the support for quicken for mac is close to abysmal again the whole point of the mac system is to make the user experience as intuitive as possible trying to figure how to make effective use of the investments component of quicken is brutal timeconsuming and most definitely not intuitivebr br on the bright side including the investments module in quicken 2015 for mac fixes the most glaring inadequacy of quicken essentials it seems to me that intuit just does not really want to support the mac product theyd much rather devote their energies to reaping huge profits from making loans i can see how they might think that anyone who can effectively manage money using their software or not would be least likely to become a debtor if theyre not willing to love this ugly in their minds stepchild then give the child up for adoption perhaps apple would be a good home for this sadly neglected child,Digital_Software

31190911,945644004,4.0,0.0,0.0,0,positive,although many have complained about the loss of features in this version of turbotax i personally did not lose any needed functionality i like turbotax overall because it offers complete flexibility in the choice of an interview format versus entering data directly into the relevant fields as a veteran tax selfpreparer i prefer the latter but occasionally find i need to use the former for new material there are aspects of turbotax that are frustrating i particularly take offense with the nickel and dime approach to adding additional state forms and the like its interesting that in new york where additional fees to file electronically are illegal there is no added cost to efile whereas in new jersey there is a substantial added cost  its deductible could be a lot more functional the degree to which i have to settle for selecting lowcost items that dont really match the more expensive ones i actually donated is frustrating beyond belief but using its deductible does lower the risk of being audited its time for a major overhaul of the program in that respect finally although cut and paste finally do work the builtin tables and worksheets do not come close to approaching the functionality of a standard spreadsheet after all these years why cant one still delete or insert a row thats just absurd  one major bright spot is that by buying turbotax through amazon i get a 10 bonus on my refund by taking it as an amazon gift card that is so nice,Digital_Software

52886406,521201578,1.0,2.0,2.0,0,negative,i have been a longtime more than 15 years and generally happy quicken user but i cannot recommend this product any longer  in the most recent release of this product it automatically assigns a password to your quicken data file making it inaccessible since you dont know the password and intuit isnt able to provide it to you  apparently this problem has persisted through two releases  intuit now allegedly has a version that fixes this problem but unfortunately you will not ever be able to access the current version of your file  quicken suggests restoring a backup copy from before the problem occurred unfortunately the most recent backup i have that doesnt have the password problem is more than a week old  intuit apologizes to me for the 34inconvenience34  if they regard the loss of more than a weeks financial data for a company is an 34inconvenience34 then i suggest they are in the wrong business  i strongly recommend against purchase of this product,Digital_Software

15392162,220827888,4.0,8.0,9.0,0,positive,overall it works fine  and due to the price im happy  it was the cheapest one available  2999 to make my 75000 computers bluray player work was definitely worth it as having a bluray player was one of the many reasons i bought the computer i did  however there is one thing that i find bothersome  however it probably wont as be as big of an issue for you as it is for meunless your internet turns off at night due to parental controls as mine does  this is what bothers me you need to be connected to the internet when you first load a bluray  otherwise youll most likely get a message that says 34unable to connect to verification server34 or the disc will just be extremely laggy and messed up  normal bluray players connected to tvs dont need the internet and im not the most techsavvy person in the world so i never expected this problem  the only time i watch movies is right before bed while im dozing off or at movie theaters  i cant stand watching movies when there is perfectly good weather outside to be in  however unless i get the bluray disk in before the internet connection turns off i wont be able to use my computer which is the easiest to use when im in bed to watch the movie  because the disk wont work unless im connected to the internet  other than that the player works great  and overall im still happy i got it  i just have that one complaint  im curious if all bluray software for computers requires constant internet connection or just this macgo one  if other bluray software doesnt need an internet connection i definitely would have paid 20 extra to not have to be connected to the internet every time i want to watch a bluray  i havent tried dvds yet  if it didnt have that one issue i wouldve given it a five star rating  and seeing as most of you wont have this same issue as me because most of you dont have internet that automatically turns off at night i would still recommend it for you  it seems like decent software,Digital_Software

25546123,83475114,1.0,2.0,2.0,0,negative,so ive used quicken for 15 years to manage all of my personal accounts including reconciliations and paying bills this version is truly dreadful while some of the features feel marginally upgraded from my 2013 version what is royally frustrating is the password requirement on opening your qdata file  the first time i converted the data i took 4 hours to reconcile my accounts and set up each account for electronic downloads  when i closed the program and opened the next day the qdata file required a password to be entered to open the program  what i never set up a password for this  none of my passwords worked so the link that says forgot password asks you to contact quicken and have them unlock your qdata file  okay so i did and after online chatting with customer service for 90 minutes and being passed back and forth they gave me a secure login  i uploaded my file on 511 and was told that the file would be unlocked in 48 hours  i connect with quicken help on 515 because  surprise no one had unlocked my file  after talking to quicken help for another 60 minutes i was told that the team was working on it and that i would receive an email letting me know when it was unlocked but i was urged to simply start the entire process over as it may be quicker well now its 525 has anyone from quicken replied to me not a chance  i then rebuilt the data again yesterday and spent two hours setting up my accounts again this time when prompted to enter a password to secure the qdata file i made sure that this option was turned off i go to login again and guess what file needs a password to spend this much money on something that is a step backwards and with that type of customer service forget this quicken just lost a lifetime customer  not again for me,Digital_Software

12720978,925385625,4.0,1.0,1.0,0,positive,even though the upgrade policy is evil which forced me to buy this i did not experience most the problems that are mentioned in other reviews  they say it is really buggy but i think its pretty much exactly the same as quicken 2012  i did have a problem logging in because you have to establish an intuit id with your email address  i had done this years ago but it failed to tell me that i already had one  instead i had problems logging in and luckily i remembered the answer to the 34favorite pet34 question that was set up years ago  then i was able to reset the passwordbr br many people mistakenly assume that since they force you to have an id then their data is 34stored in the cloud34  that is not the case  intuit is just wanting to track who their customers are and have ability to communicate with them  i do think it should be optional and i think its wrong to force this on usersbr br if you buy quicken every two years it is 25year expense  it is not that bad compared to other tools  i vowed to not buy it again after i read these bad reviews but we were going crazy scrambling for a good replacement tool for it  until someone makes a better one were pretty much stuck  i will still be on the lookout for for a replacementbr br quicken has good reporting and searching  the split expense functionality is too clunky and sometimes it doesnt save it  the memorized transactions get annoying as they remember too much and you have to go and clean them up  other than that its a reliable tool that ive used for over 10 years,Digital_Software

12422208,92330814,5.0,2.0,2.0,0,positive,the program works as advertised however their directions are less than explanatory if youre locked out of one computer you will need access to another computer to order download and execute the program if you want to burn a usb you will need to buy the professional version for 2999 you will also need to know how to boot your computer from a device other than the hard drive most computers use the f2 key to interrupt the boot process and allow you to change the sequence for example if you burn a usb then the computer must boot from the usb in order to activate the program insert the usb into its slot start the computer and continuously press f2 until the 34boot screen34 appears select usb and then follow the program instruction from start to finish the process took me two minutes some computers like hp have a selection screen that shows just prior to starting windows an option that will stop windows from starting example i needed to reset the windows 7 password on a friends computer she has an hp pavilion for about two seconds that interrupt screen shows and gave me a choice to press esc to boot from a different device like the usb so on her machine there was no pressing f2 as the computer gave me an option screen so know your computer and know which device youre going to boot from the program works if you take the time to understand your computers boot sequence,Digital_Software

33842628,437803962,2.0,0.0,0.0,0,negative,this was the original review i left for the windows install i work across many platforms and have been using amazon cloud for a while so had to figure out what was going on this is the original review followed by an updatebr br original postbr works much better on a mac than windows because you can actually move stuff into directories that sync like dropbox but its a complete fail on windows the desktop app is pointless it allows you to drag and drop files but you dont get to tell them where to go nor do you have access to your files and folders on the cloud without proceeding to the web where you then have to manually select and browse to where you want to move and download your files there isnt even a way to use desktop syncing software because there is no 34amazon cloud34 drive to sync to on the windows desktop its ridiculous and this is leaving amazon almost completely out of the cloud competition all the free space in the world doesnt make up for the pathetic interface whats so frustrating is that it seems the infrastructure is there its just not giving you full access that causes the hang up same with their cloud music player i love having access to all of my music but the lack of features in the player and complicated functionality how in the world do you remove something from the library is just intolerable i cant imagine that the photo library is going to improve much either amazon really needs to get their stuff together because they are completely missing the boat on this onebr br updatebr br ok so the reason i was getting the directories on my mac was because that was an old install so this is to confirm that the available app for mac works the same as windowsbr br however after a loooooooot of digging and researching and trial and error i think im starting to realize why the change was made i gather that the idea is to be able to collect all your data fromvarious sources and allow you to access from anywhere like every cloud does but it is actually preventing you from syncing all of your machines or devices with it because you could potentially be putting an incredible excess of data on every system this is actually a valid reason for not wanting to use a lot of cloud services its also not a very good system and sometimes not even possible to move your data to a specific local cloud directory to get it to sync so while i think amazon caught onto this in time for the big 34unlimited data34 push they havent offered very good alternatives so far the only thing ive found to work is allway sync which takes advantage of the amazon cloud drive api that is now available to allow you to setup syncing im trying it out now and it seems to be working ok but this only runs on windows im really needing something to work like this on mac i think it will soon be more accessible but for now its amazing how little information there is to try and access this cloud drive the other issue is wellwhat happens next so you sync or backup all your data and then you move to another machine where you need to access it again that amazon desktop app is almost useless the only thing its really good for is being able to toss stuff up to the drive like in an emergency in a completely unorganized fashion you hope it all gets there because theres no cancelling or pausing and youll just have to remember to go online at some point and move it to where it actually belongs if you want to retrieve any of your data you basically have to go online browse select your files or folders choose download which then saves your files as an archive to your downloads folder which you then have to extract and move to where it belongs its painful again you could use allway sync or hopefully something else that works as well to simply do all this for you but shame on amazon for not making this process just a tiny bit more simple for its users would it really even be so much to ask to retain the dropbox type folder sync structure and just have the option to flag how things get synced and unsynced yes i want to always sync from here no i do not want to ever download this directory to this machine i wonder if amazon just assumes that too many people will upload several terabytes of data which would then get unknowingly pushed around between too many devices and wreak havoc on every server because the unlimited plans are so affordable maybe thats why if you really want to use them you have to do enough research to actually figure out how to properly use them there just has to be a better way i think amazon was in a rush to try and beat out the cloud competition without flushing out a good consumerfriendly plan i personally do still have some faith that this could end up being a great solution for me but it has to get better,Digital_Software

44528776,333977962,1.0,11.0,14.0,0,negative,this is one of the most unfriendly programs i have ever used  it seems to be geared toward gps applications  does anybody really plan a trip on a pcbased program  i am in real estate and i simply want to make maps where i can place a star where i need it and label it 34comp 134 or 34subject property34  this can be done on street atlas 2015 but it requires numerous keystrokes and several tool changes and the results are still disappointing  suppose you want to find your house on a map place a star there and label it 34home34  step one is to go to the 34find34 tab to locate the property by address  it will show you dozens of hits  even though the first hit was a precise match you still have to manually select it from the list of hits  now the program automatically inserts a 34maptag34 at that address which labels the property with the street address  but you wanted it labeled 34home34 not with your street address  unfortunately the maptag cannot be edited so you must delete it which takes three more keystrokes  now that you know where the property is located on the map you must switch to the 34draw34 tab where there are various tools for inserting different types of symbols onto the map  there are very few symbols available and editing them is ridiculously complex  you cant just choose small medium large  if you want the star to be larger you have to create one from scratch one pixel at a time and you are still limited to a very small symbol  once you settle for a symbol and drag it to the map a text box automatically pops up to add a label to the symbol  that label is positioned to the upper right of the symbol and the position cannot be adjusted  so if you also put a star on the adjacent house and labeled it 34neighbor34 the labels would overlap each other  the label is also in a transparent box so it may not be clearly visible if there is a colored map feature at that particular spot on the map that conflicts with the color of your text  since the edit features for the symbol label are so lame you can just eliminate the label by hitting enter with no text  but you still want a label for your home so now you must change tools to add a 34mapnote34  at least the mapnote is a solid box and can be oriented to point from any direction so maybe you can point at your home from the top left and at your neighbors home from the bottom right  all text in the mapnote must be on a single line so dont plan on adding too long of a description  the default position for the mapnote is again upper right of where you place it  you can drag it to a different orientation but you must switch to another tool to do this  similarly if you want to edit the text in the mapnote you need to switch tools again  i hope you are getting the picture of how freaking difficult it is to simply put a star at your house and label it 34home34  nearly everything you might want to accomplish with a map program is possible with street atlas but even the simplest of tasks becomes complex and timeconsuming  the help functions do nothing to simplify the process and simply regurgitate the instructions that pop up when you hover over a symbol or task button  until recently i used a version of delorme that was about 20 years old  it was extremely easy to use and i miss it dearly  unfortunately many roads have been built since then so the underlying maps became obsolete but it was so much easier to do what i wanted to do  i have tried several version of street atlas over the years but each is less friendly than the last so i kept reverting to the old standard for as long as possible  my business partner would tease me because my printed maps showed a copyright date of 1996  now my maps have a current date but i spending a couple hours per week on a task that used to consume just a few minutes per week,Digital_Software

33842628,831433899,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,negative,works much better on a mac than windows because you can actually move stuff into directories that sync like dropbox but its a complete fail on windows the desktop app is pointless it allows you to drag and drop files but you dont get to tell them where to go nor do you have access to your files and folders on the cloud without proceeding to the web where you then have to manually select and browse to where you want to move and download your files there isnt even a way to use desktop syncing software because there is no 34amazon cloud34 drive to sync to on the windows desktop its ridiculous and this is leaving amazon almost completely out of the cloud competition all the free space in the world doesnt make up for the pathetic interface whats so frustrating is that it seems the infrastructure is there its just not giving you full access that causes the hang up same with their cloud music player i love having access to all of my music but the lack of features in the player and complicated functionality how in the world do you remove something from the library is just intolerable i cant imagine that the photo library is going to improve much either amazon really needs to get their stuff together because they are completely missing the boat on this one   update  ok so the reason i was getting the directories on my mac was because that was an old install so this is to confirm that the available app for mac works the same as windows  however after a loooooooot of digging and researching and trial and error i think im starting to realize why the change was made i gather that the idea is to be able to collect all your data from various sources and allow you to access from anywhere like every cloud does but it is actually preventing you from syncing all of your machines or devices with it because you could potentially be putting an incredible excess of data on every system this is actually a valid reason for not wanting to use a lot of cloud services its also not a very good system and sometimes not even possible to move your data to a specific local cloud directory to get it to sync so while i think amazon caught onto this in time for the big 34unlimited data34 push they havent offered very good alternatives so far the only thing ive found to work is allway sync which takes advantage of the amazon cloud drive api that is now available to allow you to setup syncing im trying it out now and it seems to be working ok but this only runs on windows im really needing something to work like this on mac i think it will soon be more accessible but for now its amazing how little information there is to try and access this cloud drive the other issue is wellwhat happens next so you sync or backup all your data and then you move to another machine where you need to access it again that amazon desktop app is almost useless the only thing its really good for is being able to toss stuff up to the drive like in an emergency in a completely unorganized fashion you hope it all gets there because theres no cancelling or pausing and youll just have to remember to go online at some point and move it to where it actually belongs if you want to retrieve any of your data you basically have to go online browse select your files or folders choose download which then saves your files as an archive to your downloads folder which you then have to extract and move to where it belongs its painful again you could use allway sync or hopefully something else that works as well to simply do all this for you but shame on amazon for not making this process just a tiny bit more simple for its users would it really even be so much to ask to retain the dropbox type folder sync structure and just have the option to flag how things get synced and unsynced yes i want to always sync from here no i do not want to ever download this directory to this machinei wonder if amazon just assumes that too many people will upload several terabytes of data which would then get unknowingly pushed around between too many devices and wreak havoc on every server because the unlimited plans are so affordable maybe thats why if you really want to use them you have to do enough research to actually figure out how to properly use them there just has to be a better way i think amazon was in a rush to try and beat out the cloud competition without flushing out a good consumerfriendly plan i personally do still have some faith that this could end up being a great solution for me but it has to get better,Digital_Software

50893317,521201578,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,negative,after reading all of the negative reviews it was a painful decision to buy this like others here i can no longer download transactions using my 2012 version and know myself enough to realize that i will never go through the hassle of manually downloading them from each of my financial institutions so i bought the cd version thinking that maybe installation would go more smoothly than the download and at the very least it would be easier to return under quickens 60day money back guaranteebr br installation onto my computer went okay but getting my accounts up and running took a lot of patience heres whybr 1 youre forced to sign up signin to your intuitcom account and then separately into a quickencom account this seems to be related to the mobile app as well as tracking investments of course i havent signed into either of those websites in years so i had to initiate password resets with bothbr 2 once the software was up and running none of my accounts were able to successfully download new transactions the whole point of upgrading to this software at first i tried reentering my passwords for each account no go then i tried 34resetting34 the online services when youre in a particular account register click on the setting gear icon in the upper right and hit 34edit account details34 the reset button is under the online services tab this sort of worked  but it also caused the software to hang each and every time i did it i probably used ctrlaltdel five times to force the program closed finally i resorted to 34deactivating34 each online service and setting them up from scratch that worked without causing the program to hangbr br with those steps out of the way the software is mostly operating how i expect it to but its still buggy for example i have several old investment accounts that have been closed for years i had marked them as closed in the previous version of quicken and had them hidden from view now several of them have reappeared in the accounts panel under the heading 34separate34 these accounts are not added to my net worth but still its really annoying to see a balance there when i had zeroed them out a long time ago the kicker is if i click buttons to 34close account34 it just opens a window with instructions on how to close the account in other words the software programmers forgot to actually program that function inbr br so long story short if youve been using quicken for years it is possible to use this software and retain some of the functionality that you had in previous versions be prepared for a good dose of frustration though,Digital_Software

48024766,564044211,4.0,0.0,1.0,0,positive,i purchased office 2013 via office 365 so the big upfront cost was not a consideration office 365 is not software its a way of financing the use of this software see my review on office 365 4 stars so far i had been buying office using office home and student as a base and purchasing outlook and publisher separately this review is based on my personal and semiprofessional use of office itself all applications except access  the installupgrade went seamlessly i upgraded from 2007 and find the new look and features improved and useful perhaps because i skipped office 2010 i agree with others that more appearance styles should be available the 3 options dont tone it down quite enough for me too much pure white and the contrast between active and inactive functions is not obvious enough a light gray background would help although i do like the much crisper look of the application screens in general more theme choices would be better navigation is somewhat different but so far not hard to learn or more difficult to use reasonably logical and intuitive  i like that the splash screens show progress on loading especially the loading of addins outlook loads slowly for me as i keep a lot of emails active in the current personal file tens of thousands and i was able to deactivate a number of microsoft addins that i will never use to speed that up the silliest thing is taking up space on the outlook display for pictures of correspondents and there doesnt seem to be any way to remove that which really should be possible what a waste of screen space very touchyfeely social networking stuff but who really wants or needs all those blank photo places staring out at you  i have used customized toolbars since they became available and the ability to move the quick access toolbar right down to above the workspace is very convenient i have customized them in each application with the 20 to 30 or so functions that i use most often and rarelyhave to go to the ribbon and sort through the tabs which is cumbersome well worth the few minutes of set up if i find myself using a new function regularly i add it there  generally the applications seem to load and run faster although i wish that they all could use more of my 15gb of ram to run even better unlike some others i dont find he availability of one drive especially intrusive yes its there as the first choice when you save a new file but if you dont want to use it you just ignore it im not likely to want the bulk of my important and personal data out on a cloud somewhere but could it see it perhaps  someday as a place for my sizeable music files if i needed to free up space on an internal drive or maybe for photos or videos for people that have such things  on the whole a good value especially the way that i bought it only 4 stars because i dont have much experience with it yet,Digital_Software

41579372,925385625,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,negative,i currently have quicken deluxe 2004 on an old xp pc  when i add a new entry it moves on to the next entry instantaneously  i downloaded quicken deluxe 2015 to install on my brand new high performance laptop running windows 81  i converted my existing database over  when i try to add a new entry it takes almost a minute for it to move on  is this supposed to be an upgrade  i tried downloading the latest patches but nothing leads to a useable result  update july 11 2015 since i paid 40 for this software i figured i should look a little more into what was causing the huge delays  it turned out that the root cause was the excessive overdue reminders that were added to the list during the conversion process reminders for things like restaurant purchases payments to defunct cards and many other things that no longer needed any reminders or never needed any reminders  so every time i would try to add a new entry it had to search the thousands of bogus overdue reminders for a possible match  after about an hour of deleting the reminders one payee at a time since you apparently cant select a group of reminders to delete it finally started to take much less time to process each operation  it is now running nearly as good on my brand new laptop as the 2004 version did on a very old xp pc  i pushed it up to 2 stars since it is an overall improvement featureswise compared to 2004 but i would never consider 3 or more stars since it does occasionally crash for no reason  there was also some cleanup i had to do in the registers since during the conversion many bogus transfers were added between accounts with values in the quadrillions of dollars  with the reminders cleaned up it didnt take too long to get rid of those  in short i am happy to not need to use my old xp pc anymore but i am not happy that i need to get used to the quirks of this new version of quicken  new versions of any software should generally be for providing a more useable intuitive streamlined and faster interface  this is not that,Digital_Software

filemaker pro advanced developer version filemaker go webdirect and filemaker serverbr br here we provide overview of some of the new features of filemaker 14 along with a few notes and links to many resources for more detailed information some of the big goals of filemaker 14 includedbr br 1 creating solutions quickly and at low costbr 2 supporting mobile solutions even betterbr 3 delivering browserbased solutions with improved webdirectbr 4 making the platform reliable secure and scalablebr br filemaker 14br br many of the features of filemaker 14 are developerfocused enhancements end users those that may not actually develop or code may not see them immediately but they will see improved speed of delivery of new features and ability to create new functionality that was not possible in the pastbr br the system requirements for filemaker pro are mac os 109 or windows 7 and above there are now separate versions of filemaker for windows 32 and 64 bit clients be careful with plugins that may only support the 32 bit version you may need to update them firstbr br the filemaker interface has been modernized and has become more flat according to recent design trendsbr br script workspace  major changes have been made to the editing of scripts you can now type scripts with context sensitive helpbr br calculation dialog box  all new and enhanced to make it as easy as possible to create calculations quicklybr br design tool enhancements  many tools and options are new or modernizedbr br  improved color picker  with theme color optionsbr  button bars  you can now define a row or column of buttons with uniform size and formatting they are made up of segments that are buttons or popover buttons text label icon or both can be added to each segmentbr  field placeholders  infield labels  allow you to clearly label fields by showing what they are when empty without taking valuable screen realestatebr  button icons  custom button glyphs for buttons popover buttons and button bar segmentscustom icon in svg format conditional formatting of the button icon also include color optionsbr  navigation parts  top and bottom layout partsbr  object component styles to control how objects look  customize formatting of component parts of control styles popup menu dropdown list dropdown calendar checkbox set and radio button setbr launch center and file icons  present a new clean way to select databasesbr br minimalist or minimalist touch themes  new themes should start with these themes that provide a clean slate with no custom predefined stylesbr br better starter solutions  event management and projects prebuilt templates have been enhancedbr br filemaker webdirectbr br webdirect is the option that allows filemaker databases to be deployed quickly to the web and maintain a lot of the filemaker type of functionalitybr br webdirect is now substantially faster up to 25 and less resource intensive now the user limit has increased from 50 simultaneous users to 100 webdirect now supports mobile browsers like chrome for androidbr br filemaker go 14br br filemaker go provides more control on ios through the following featuresbr br  the new user interface that cleans up the icons and makes them more intuitivebr  rich text editing in fieldsbr  new functions include getscreenscalefactor getmenubarstate and gettouchkeyboardstatebr  insert from device now has additional customization options for signature capturebr  scripts that lock screen orientation portrait portrait upside down landscape left landscape right enhance signature capture allow control of video and audio playback and enable touch keyboardsbr  the new refresh portal script command can speed up some operations it is more specific than refresh window flush cached join resultsbr  showhide menubar option for filemaker go and webdirectbr  enable touch keyboard  for ios or windows 8 when then tap into an editable fieldbr br filemaker 14 serverbr br reconnect to server when a connection is lost in filemaker pro should save a lot of frustration previous versions of filemaker pro required login whenever a computer went to sleep or the network connection changed it does this by allowing the fmreauthenticate extended privilege to apply to filemaker pro clients not just filemaker go if the machine goes to sleep when you return you are auto reconnected if time is within the limit for example fmreauthenticate120 would be a 2 hour setting minutes the maximum time limit is 10080 minutes or 7 daysbr br the new standby server option for experienced system administrators aids in upgrades and maintenance it takes over for a primary server if it is offline or unavailable the server config and hosted data files must be identical it can be used for unexpected failure of server due to power loss hard drive or catastrophe or a planned server outage the changeover process is manual and configured by command line so it isnt designed to be used as automatic failover this second standby server does not require an additional software license progressive backup must be enabled for both installationsbr br conclusionbr br filemaker 14 represents a big step forward in providing additional features performance enhancements and security  reliability while balancing it with maintaining its ease of usebr br existing filemaker solutions do not automatically gain all of the features of filemaker 14 some features will require reworking of layouts scripts and other objectsdevelopment time to take advantage of the new capabilitiesbr br we

34206183,608720080,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,negative,i just had an amazing experience trying to get avast to stop auto renewing their product and debiting my account unlike other online subscription services avast provides only one very obscure and very poorly documented way to change your payment method or to update your subscription preferences you cannot make changes through your account on their website and you cannot make changes through the account settings in the application telephone customer service cannot help and several people on their forums confirm my experience of no response to service tickets you have to find a well hidden link by searching the forums then you have to enter information that is only available in the order confirmation email they send you each year only then do you get access to a link that opens a form that will let you manage your payment and subscription be aware that they assign you a different order number and password every time you renew so you have to get the information from the most recent renewal and not from the original order you will get a look at your order but there will be no options to change your payment method or cancel your order it looks to me like they contracted out their subscription management to digital river and have not done a good job of integrating digital rivers processes into their own interfacebr br if you like avast and want to upgrade to a premium product i highly recommend that you not give your credit card information to avast instead i suggest you pay for it one year at a time by ordering through amazon besides maintaining control over access to your bank account you will probably pay a lot less each yearbr br i have to say that i liked avast it was a friendly and effective product a few years ago they started pushing more and more promotions through the alerts in the system tray it got to the point that i had to switch to a different product that maintained a lower profilebr br it took me almost 6 hours to figure out how to get avast to not renew my license and stay out of my bank account i am now using a different product that lets me manage my payment options directly and easily it kind of felt like avast had become the malware that it is supposed to protect me from please be carefulo figure out how to get avast to not renew my license and stay out of my bank account i am now using a different product that lets me manage my payment options directly and easily it kind of felt like avast had become the malware that it is supposed to protect me from please be careful,Digital_Software

51220294,945644004,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,negative,turbotax premier 2014 has prominent and potentially very costly problems with the features for which youre paying extra  if your tax situation is simple and you dont efile you could probably be satisfied with the free or inexpensive online versions of turbotax  but i have a few complications and in the past turbotax deluxe was good enough  this year they modified their feature sets so i opted for turbotax premier  what a disasterbr the problems arebr 1 the interface for handling isos and espp stock transactions is cumbersome  i know tax rules changed but it is much more cumbersome than the interface from turbotax 2013 while the information needed for the new tax rules really is not much morebr 2 handling disposition of partnership interests where a 1099 was also issued is about as bad as it gets  you can handle it with turbotax 2014 but there is enough paper tracking manual calculation and manual entry that the software provides no benefit vs doing it on paper the old school waybr 3 worst of all there appears to be a security leak that allowed fraudulent efiling of federal taxes so that the perpetrators could get refunds deposited to ad hoc bank accountsbr br buying turbotax premier 2014 was a total waste of money and i look forward to joining the class action suit for the security issue  thanks to good timing in dealing with the fraudulent efile im only taking a loss for the cost of turbotax premier but honestly thats about all i expect a class action suit would get me,Digital_Software
